        "question": "What is App Mining?",
        "answer": "<p>Traditionally the term mining in cryptocurrency refers to the process of contributing compute resources to the network and earning a reward. In the Blockstack Ecosystem, instead of just mining through computation, developers mine by building apps and the Blockstack community funds them simply for being pioneers in the emerging Blockchain software market.</p> <p>We believe app mining represents a revolution in app funding, allowing small teams to bootstrap without advertising or venture capital. Each month, qualifying apps compete for funding. Qualified apps are evaluated and ranked by expert app reviewers. The better your app, the higher payout you earn.</p> <p>The pilot run began on December 1st 2018, with 34 Blockstack Apps enrolled. A previous alpha run in Oct 2018 included 17 Blockstack apps. App mining is a new mining model that we expect will evolve and improve over time. We look forward to feedback from our community regarding the App Mining process and program.</p>"

        "question": "How is App Mining different from cryptocurrency mining?",
        "answer": "<p>Traditionally the term mining in cryptocurrency refers to the process of contributing compute resources to the network and earning a distributed of new tokens as a reward. On the Stacks blockchain, developers can <q>mine</q> by contributing apps to the ecosystem and making applications the community wants. </p>"
     },
     {
        "question": "What qualifies my app to compete in App Mining?",
        "answer": "<p>Your app should integrate Blockstack authentication for logging into your app. Your finished app should be available to the public for use.  The application must use a registered domain name and the app should be hosted at a URL belonging to the domain. The app website must use a secured (<code>https</code>) connection. In the future, App Mining may reward apps that have taken steps to further decentralize, such as utilizing Gaia storage or the publishing your app to the Blockstack Naming System. Test flight apps, hello-world apps and apps created through blockstack tutorials (e.g., animal kingdom apps) do not qualify.</p>"

     {
        "question": "Who are the app reviewers?",
        "answer": "<p>App reviewers are currently selected by Blockstack PBC. Reviewers are entities that have a proprietary methodology that helps them make objective judgements for why a certain app might be better than others. We strive to engage a diverse coalition of app reviewers with the goal of making application ranking objective and resilient to abuse.</p> <p>The app reviewers are Product Hunt, TryMyUI, Awario, and the New Internet Labs. See <a href='https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/app-reviewers.html' target='_blank'>here</a> for more details about each reviewer. Future reviewers could expand to community election.

     {
        "question": "How are apps ranked?",
        "answer": "<p>App reviewers have a proprietary methodology that helps them make objective judgments for why one app might be better than another. Each app reviewers determines the data, formula, and personnel they wish to utilize. For example, Product Hunt can tap into their community data to determine relative app popularity. Reviewers must publish their methodology periodically to ensure transparency.</p> <p>To learn more see <a href='https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/app-reviewers.html' target='_blank'>the detailed explanation of our ranking algorithm on our</a> <a href='https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/app-reviewers.html' target='_blank'>documentation</a>.</p> <p>Apps are ranked by all app reviewers.</p>"

        "question": "Do I have to Hunt my app on Product Hunt?",
        "answer": "<p>As part of the ranking process, there is an assessment by App Reviewer Product Hunt via their community vote and their internal team vote. More info on the algorithm, <a href='https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/mining_intro.html'>here</a>. The Hunt launch will have an impact on your final ranking, as you can see in the algorithm breakdown. Here is <a href='https://blog.producthunt.com/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-7c1843e06399'>more info</a> on Product Hunt launch best practices. In general, sharing and responsiveness to questions are encouraged, and it might help your community reception if you choose to hunt the app yourself. If not, Product Hunt can hunt your App as well.</p><p>Apps will be hunted every 6 months, so if you hunted your app in a past month, as long as you are in the 6 month time window, you will not have to Hunt the app. </p>"

        "question": "When are the winning payments made?",
        "answer": "<p>Payouts are made on the 15th of every month.</p>"
     },
     {
        "question": "What are examples of any quantitative metrics that may be shared with app reviewers?",
        "answer": "<p>Qualitative metrics are metrics that evaluate elements such as engagement, DAU/MAU ratios, etc. from the reviewed apps. Blockstack plans to incorporate metrics based ranking. However, before we do, any mechanism must thoughtfully incorporate the digital privacy rights of Blockstack users, and provide information in a way that cannot be gamed.</p> "
     },
     {
        "question": "Is App Mining Decentralized?",
        "answer": "<p>Given the pioneering nature of the program, we are being careful and starting in a somewhat centralized fashion that allows for necessary diligence in the early stages, for example, the current pilot phase. We don’t want to bake in assumptions that have not been validated. The downside of this protection is some level of centralization, which we are taking steps to reduce over time. The pilot is the just the first step in creating a fair system that can be relied upon by founders and contribute to the growth of the Blockstack ecosystem. </p> <p>Blockstack plans to move along a path to decentralization and App Mining will too. It is important to highlight that initially, App Mining will purposely have a few points of centralization highlighted below, which can become decentralized over time (all plans are subject to change, legal approval, and applicable law). </p> <h5>Electing app reviewers:</h5> <p>Currently, Blockstack PBC elects app reviewers. In the future, we anticipate gradually transitioning to community elections of App Reviewers. </p> <h5>Registering apps:</h5> <p>Currently, registering apps is regulated by Blockstack PBC through app.co/mining. In the future, we anticipate transitioning to publishing on designated Blockstack namespaces via our public blockchain. </p> <h5>Collecting votes:</h5> <p>Currently, votes are aggregated by Blockstack PBC and administered via App.co. In the future, we expect that votes will be collected through the protocol itself. </p> <h5>Issuing money:</h5> <p>Currently, payouts are issued by Blockstack PBC. In the future, we expect that payouts will over time be generated and deployed on an automated basis. </p>"

     {
        "question": "How is App Mining protected against bribery, collusion, or gaming?",
        "answer": "<p>We are taking potential threats very seriously and hope to create a fair system that continuously reinforces trust within our community for the long term. </p> <p>We are currently consulting with a team of 3 Ph.D. Game Theorist professors from Princeton University and New York University to determine thoughtful methods to protect App Mining from being attacked and/or abused. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible, but App Reviewers may reserve the right to keep some secrets in their formula to avoid bribes and gaming, and the algorithm that combines all of these score may be tuned in the future to account for new learnings. </p> <p>The Game Theorists are working with us to create a technical paper and broader documents like blogs explaining the overall mechanism.</p>"
