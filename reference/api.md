# API

### Introduction

The Stacks Blockchain API allows you to query the Stacks blockchain and interact with smart contracts. It was built to maintain pageable materialized views of the Stacks Blockchain.

Note that the [Stacks Node RPC API](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain/) and the [Hiro Stacks API](https://www.hiro.so/stacks-api) are two different things. The Hiro API is a centralized service run by Hiro, a developer tooling company, that makes it easy to get onboarded and begin interacting with the Stacks blockchain in a RESTful way. You can also [run your own API server](https://docs.hiro.so/get-started/running-api-node).

The Hiro Stacks API is a proxy for the Stacks Node API that makes it a bit easier to work with by providing additional functionality.

The RPC API is generated by every Stacks node and allows developers to self-host their own node and API for a more decentralized architecture.

The RPC API can be used without any authorization. The basepath for the API is:

```bash
# for mainnet, replace `testnet` with `mainnet`
https://api.testnet.hiro.so/
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you run a local node, it exposes an HTTP server on port `20443`. The info endpoint would be `localhost:20443/v2/info`.
{% endhint %}

You can view the reference docs for the [Stacks RPC API](https://docs.hiro.so/stacks/api) on Hiro's documentation.
