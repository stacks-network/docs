## Introduction

This guide helps you understand how to set up and run a mocknet for local development with Docker.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/) >= `1.27.4`
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [`jq` binary](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo locally:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev ./stacks-local-dev && cd ./stacks-local-dev
```

2. Copy sample.env to .env:

```bash
  cp sample.env .env
```

3. Start the Mocknet:

```bash
./manage.sh mocknet up
```

4. Stop the Mocknet:

```bash
./manage.sh mocknet down
```

## Env Vars

All variables used in the [`.env`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev/blob/master/.env) file can be modified, but generally most of them should be left as-is.

### Locally opened ports

In this section of the [`.env`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev/blob/master/.env) file, the values can be modified to change the ports opened locally by docker.

Currently, default port values are used - but if you have a running service on any of the defined ports, they can be adjusted to any locally available port.

ex:

```bash
POSTGRES_PORT_LOCAL=5432
EXPLORER_PORT_LOCAL=3000
```

Can be adjusted to:

```bash
POSTGRES_PORT_LOCAL=5433
EXPLORER_PORT_LOCAL=3001
```

Docker will still use the default ports _internally_ - this modification will only affect how the **host** OS accesses the services.

For example, to access postgres (using the **new** port `5433`) after running `./manage.sh mocknet up`:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD='postgres' && psql --host localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d stacks_node_api
```

### System Resources

All sections in the [`.env`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev/blob/master/.env) file have specific CPU/MEM values, and can be adjusted to work in your local enviroment.

The variables take the form of `xxxx_CPU` and `xxxx_MEM`.

ex:

```bash
STACKS_MINER_CPU=0.3
STACKS_MINER_MEM=128M
STACKS_FOLLOWER_CPU=0.3
STACKS_FOLLOWER_MEM=128M
```

### Bitcoin

Mocknet does not require any settings for bitcoin

### Postgres

Default password is easy to guess, and we do open a port to postgres locally.

This password is defined in the file [./postgres/stacks-node-api.sql](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev/blob/master/postgres/stacks-node-api.sql#L1)

If you update this value to something other than `postgres`, you'll have to adjust the value in the [`.env`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev/blob/master/.env) file as well, as the mocknet API uses this:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
```

## Running a local mocknet

### Install/Update docker-compose

First, check if you have `docker-compose` installed locally:

```bash
docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.27.4, build 40524192
```

If the command is not found, or the version is < `1.27.4`, run the following to install the latest to `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose`:

```bash
VERSION=$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | jq .name -r)
DESTINATION=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o $DESTINATION
sudo chmod 755 $DESTINATION
```

### Ensure all images are up to date

You can run the following at anytime to ensure the local images are up to date:

```bash
./manage.sh mocknet pull
```

### Services Running in Mocknet

**Mocknet service names**:

- follower
- api
- postgres

**Docker container names**:

- mocknet_stacks-node-follower
- mocknet_stacks-node-api
- mocknet_postgres

#### Starting Mocknet Services

Start all services:

    ```bash
    ./manage.sh mocknet up
    ```

#### Stopping Mocknet Services

Stop all services:

    ```bash
    ./manage.sh mocknet down
    ```

Or restart:

    ```bash
    ./manage.sh mocknet restart
    ```

#### Retrieving Mocknet logs

Tail logs with docker-compose:

    ```bash
    ./manage.sh mocknet logs
    ```

## Accessing the services

**stacks-node-follower**:

- Ports `20443-20444` are **only** exposed to the `mocknet` docker network.

**stacks-node-api**:

- Ports `3700, 3999` are exposed to `localhost`

```bash
curl localhost:3999/v2/info | jq
```

**postgres**:

- Port `5432` is exposed to `localhost` (PGPASSWORD is defined in [`.env`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev/blob/master/.env))

```bash
export PGPASSWORD='postgres' && psql --host localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d stacks_node_api
```

## Potential issues

### Port already in use

If you have a port conflict, typically this means you already have a process using that same port.

To resolve, find the port you have in use (for example, `5432` and edit the [`.env`](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-local-dev/blob/master/.env) file to use the new port)

```bash
netstat -anl | grep 5432
tcp46      0      0  *.5432                 *.*                    LISTEN
```

### Containers not starting

Occasionally, docker can get **stuck** and not allow new containers to start. If this happens, simply restart your docker daemon and try again.

### BNS username not found

The mocknet is launched without the import of Stacks 1.0 name, only the test genesis chain state is imported. To change that comment out the corresponding line in `stacks-node-follower/Config.toml.template` like this:

```
# use_test_genesis_chainstate = true
```

### panic on launch

Verify that the path of the config file is correct in the `.env` file, in particular on Windows OS the slash (`/`) in path names can cause errors.
