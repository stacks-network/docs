## Deploy your GAIA hub

Tutorials to deploy your own GAIA hub are currently available for [Linux](./setup-linux), [MacOS](./setup-mac) and [Amazon EC2 / CloudFormation](./gaia-on-ec2).

Regardless of what server the Gaia Hub runs on, the storage it uses can currently be deployed on multiple platforms:

- Local disk (the server itself)
- Amazon S3
- Azure Blob Storage
- Google Cloud
