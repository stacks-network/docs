## Help with translations

Translations are managed with Crowin.  
Anybody can colaborate and no technichal skills are required, as it's all done on the browser.

To help with translation please go to [this page](https://crowdin.com/project/docsstacksco), click any language and start translating.

All help is appreciated.

-> Please don't add any translations to the Github repository, as the translated pages get rewritten from Crowin. Translations need to be added on Crowin intead.
