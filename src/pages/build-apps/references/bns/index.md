Blockchain Naming System (BNS) is a network system that binds Stacks usernames
to off-chain state without relying on any central points of control.

The Stacks V1 blockchain implemented BNS through first-order name operations.
In Stacks V2, BNS is instead implemented through a smart-contract loaded
during the genesis block.

Names in BNS have three properties:

- **Names are globally unique.** The protocol does not allow name collisions, and all
  well-behaved nodes resolve a given name to the same state.
- **Names are human-meaningful.** Each name is chosen by its creator.
- **Names are strongly owned.** Only the name's owner can change the state it
  resolves to. Specifically, a name is owned by one or more ECDSA private keys.

The Stacks blockchain insures that each node's BNS view is
synchronized to all of the other nodes in the world, so queries on one
node will be the same on other nodes. Stacks blockchain nodes allow a
name's owner to bind up to 40Kb of off-chain state to their name,
which will be replicated to all other Stacks blockchain nodes via a P2P network.

The biggest consequence for developers is that in BNS, reading name state is
fast and cheap but writing name state is slow and expensive. This is because
registering and modifying names requires one or more transactions to be sent to
the underlying blockchain, and BNS nodes will not process them until they are
sufficiently confirmed. Users and developers need to acquire and spend
the requisite cryptocurrency (STX) to send BNS transactions.

## Motivation behind naming systems

We rely on naming systems in everyday life, and they play a critical
role in many different applications. For example, when you look up a
friend on social media, you are using the platform's naming system to resolve
their name to their profile. When you look up a website, you are using the
Domain Name Service to
resolve the hostname to its host's IP address. When you check out a Git branch, you
are using your Git client to resolve the branch name to a commit hash.
When you look up someone's PGP key on a keyserver, you are resolving
their key ID to their public key.

What kinds of things do we want to be true about names? In BNS, names are
globally unique, names are human-meaningful, and names are strongly owned.
However, if you look at these examples, you'll see that each of them only
guarantees _two_ of these properties. This limits how useful they can be.

- In DNS and social media, names are globally unique and human-readable, but not
  strongly owned. The system operator has the
  final say as to what each names resolves to.

  - **Problem**: Clients must trust the system to make the right
    choice in what a given name resolves to. This includes trusting that
    no one but the system administrators can make these changes.

- In Git, branch names are human-meaningful
  and strongly owned, but not globally unique. Two different Git nodes may resolve the same
  branch name to different unrelated repository states.

  - **Problem**: Since names can refer to conflicting state, developers
    have to figure out some other mechanism to resolve ambiguities. In Git's
    case, the user has to manually intervene.

- In PGP, names are key IDs. They are
  are globally unique and cryptographically owned, but not human-readable. PGP
  key IDs are derived from the keys they reference.
  - **Problem**: These names are difficult for most users to
    remember since they do not carry semantic information relating to their use in the system.

BNS names have all three properties, and none of these problems. This makes it a
powerful tool for building all kinds of network applications. With BNS, we
can do the following and more:

- Build domain name services where hostnames can't be hijacked.
- Build social media platforms where user names can't be stolen by phishers.
- Build version control systems where repository branches do not conflict.
- Build public-key infrastructure where it's easy for users to discover and
  remember each other's keys.

## Organization of BNS

BNS names are organized into a global name hierarchy. There are three different
layers in this hierarchy related to naming:

- **Namespaces**. These are the top-level names in the hierarchy. An analogy
  to BNS namespaces are DNS top-level domains. Existing BNS namespaces include
  `.id`, `.podcast`, and `.helloworld`. All other names belong to exactly one
  namespace. Anyone can create a namespace, but in order for the namespace
  to be persisted, it must be _launched_ so that anyone can register names in it.
  Namespaces are not owned by their creators.

- **BNS names**. These are names whose records are stored directly on the
  blockchain. The ownership and state of these names are controlled by sending
  blockchain transactions. Example names include `verified.podcast` and
  `muneeb.id`. Anyone can create a BNS name, as long as the namespace that
  contains it exists already.

- **BNS subdomains**. These are names whose records are stored off-chain,
  but are collectively anchored to the blockchain. The ownership and state for
  these names lives within the P2P network data. While BNS
  subdomains are owned by separate private keys, a BNS name owner must
  broadcast their subdomain state. Example subdomains include `jude.personal.id`
  and `podsaveamerica.verified.podcast`. Unlike BNS namespaces and names, the
  state of BNS subdomains is _not_ part of the blockchain consensus rules.

A feature comparison matrix summarizing the similarities and differences
between these name objects is presented below:

| Feature                                | **Namespaces** | **BNS names** | **BNS Subdomains** |

| State hosted off-chain                 |                | X             | X                  |

## Namespaces

Namespaces are the top-level naming objects in BNS.

They control a few properties about the names within them:

- How expensive they are to register
- How long they last before they have to be renewed
- Who (if anyone) receives the name registration fees
- Who is allowed to seed the namespace with its initial names.

At the time of this writing, by far the largest BNS namespace is the `.id`
namespace. Names in the `.id` namespace are meant for resolving user
identities. Short names in `.id` are more expensive than long names, and have
to be renewed by their owners every two years. Name registration fees are not
paid to anyone in particular---they are instead sent to a "black hole" where
they are rendered unspendable (the intention is to discourage ID squatters).

Unlike DNS, _anyone_ can create a namespace and set its properties. Namespaces
are created on a first-come first-serve basis, and once created, they last
forever.

However, creating a namespace is not free. The namespace creator must _burn_
cryptocurrency to do so. The shorter the namespace, the more cryptocurrency
must be burned (that is, short namespaces are more valuable than long namespaces).
For example, it cost Blockstack PBC 40 BTC to create the `.id` namespace in 2015
(in transaction
`5f00b8e609821edd6f3369ee4ee86e03ea34b890e242236cdb66ef6c9c6a1b281`).

Namespaces can be between 1 and 19 characters long, and are composed of the
characters `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, and `_`.

## Subdomains

BNS names are strongly owned because the owner of its private key can generate
valid transactions that update its zone file hash and owner. However, this comes at the
cost of requiring a name owner to pay for the underlying transaction in the
blockchain. Moreover, this approach limits the rate of BNS name registrations
and operations to the underlying blockchain's transaction bandwidth.

BNS overcomes this with subdomains. A **BNS subdomain** is a type of
BNS name whose state and owner are stored outside of the blockchain,
but whose existence and operation history are anchored to the
blockchain. Like their on-chain counterparts, subdomains are globally
unique, strongly owned, and human-readable. BNS gives them their own
name state and public keys. Unlike on-chain names, subdomains can be
created and managed cheaply, because they are broadcast to the BNS
network in batches. A single blockchain transaction can send up to 120
subdomain operations.

This is achieved by storing subdomain records in the BNS name zone files.
An on-chain name owner broadcasts subdomain operations by encoding them as
`TXT` records within a DNS zone file. To broadcast the zone file,
the name owner sets the new zone file hash with a `NAME_UPDATE` transaction and
replicates the zone file. This, in turn, replicates all subdomain
operations it contains, and anchors the set of subdomain operations to
an on-chain transaction. The BNS node's consensus rules ensure that only
valid subdomain operations from _valid_ `NAME_UPDATE` transactions will ever be
stored.

For example, the name `verified.podcast` once wrote the zone file hash `247121450ca0e9af45e85a82e61cd525cd7ba023`,
which is the hash of the following zone file:

Each `TXT` record in this zone file encodes a subdomain-creation.
For example, `1yeardaily.verified.podcast` resolves to:

```json
{
  "address": "1MwPD6dH4fE3gQ9mCov81L1DEQWT7E85qH",
  "blockchain": "bitcoin",
  "last_txid": "d87a22ebab3455b7399bfef8a41791935f94bc97aee55967edd5a87f22cce339",

  "zonefile_txt": "$ORIGIN 1yeardaily\n$TTL 3600\n_http._tcp URI 10 1 \"https://ph.dotpodcast.co/1yeardaily/head.json\"\n"
}
```

This information was extracted from the `1yeardaily` `TXT` resource record in the zone
file for `verified.podcast`.

### Subdomain Lifecycle

Note that `1yeardaily.verified.podcast` has a different public key
hash (address) than `verified.podcast`. A BNS node will only process a
subsequent subdomain operation on `1yeardaily.verified.podcast` if it includes a
signature from this address's private key. `verified.podcast` cannot generate
updates; only the owner of `1yeardaily.verified.podcast can do so`.

The lifecycle of a subdomain and its operations is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2:  Subdomain lifetime with respect to on-chain name operations .A new
subdomain operation will only be accepted if it has a later "sequence=" number,
and a valid signature in "sig=" over the transaction body .The "sig=" field
includes both the public key and signature, and the public key must hash to
the previous subdomain operation's "addr=" field.

The subdomain-creation and subdomain-transfer transactions for
"cicero.res_publica.id" are broadcast by the owner of "res_publica.id."
However, any on-chain name ("jude.id" in this case) can broadcast a subdomain
update for "cicero.res_publica.id."
```

Subdomain operations are ordered by sequence number, starting at 0. Each new
subdomain operation must include:

- The next sequence number
- The public key that hashes to the previous subdomain transaction's address
- A signature from the corresponding private key over the entire subdomain
  operation.

If two correctly signed but conflicting subdomain operations are discovered
(that is, they have the same sequence number), the one that occurs earlier in the
blockchain's history is accepted. Invalid subdomain operations are ignored.

Combined, this ensures that a BNS node with all of the zone files with a given
subdomain's operations will be able to determine the valid sequence of
state-transitions it has undergone, and determine the current zone file and public
key hash for the subdomain.

### Subdomain Creation and Management

Unlike an on-chain name, a subdomain owner needs an on-chain name owner's help
to broadcast their subdomain operations. In particular:

- A subdomain-creation transaction can only be processed by the owner of the on-chain
  name that shares its suffix. For example, only the owner of `res_publica.id`
  can broadcast subdomain-creation transactions for subdomain names ending in
  `.res_publica.id`.
- A subdomain-transfer transaction can only be broadcast by the owner of the
  on-chain name that created it. For example, the owner of
  `cicero.res_publica.id` needs the owner of `res_publica.id` to broadcast a
  subdomain-transfer transaction to change `cicero.res_publica.id`'s public key.
- In order to send a subdomain-creation or subdomain-transfer, all
  of an on-chain name owner's zone files must be present in the Atlas network.
  This lets the BNS node prove the _absence_ of any conflicting subdomain-creation and
  subdomain-transfer operations when processing new zone files.
- A subdomain update transaction can be broadcast by _any_ on-chain name owner,
  but the subdomain owner needs to find one who will cooperate. For example,
  the owner of `verified.podcast` can broadcast a subdomain-update transaction
  created by the owner of `cicero.res_publica.id`.

That said, to create a subdomain, the subdomain owner generates a
subdomain-creation operation for their desired name
and gives it to the on-chain name owner.

Once created, a subdomain owner can use any on-chain name owner to broadcast a
subdomain-update operation. To do so, they generate and sign the requisite
subdomain operation and give it to an on-chain name owner, who then packages it
with other subdomain operations into a DNS zone file and broadcasts it to the network.

If the subdomain owner wants to change the address of their subdomain, they need
to sign a subdomain-transfer operation and give it to the on-chain name owner
who created the subdomain. They then package it into a zone file and broadcast
it.

### Subdomain Registrars

Because subdomain names are cheap, developers may be inclined to run
subdomain registrars on behalf of their applications. For example,
the name `personal.id` is used to register usernames without
requiring them to spend any Bitcoin.

We supply a reference implementation of a [BNS Subdomain
Registrar](https://github.com/stacks-network/subdomain-registrar) to help
developers broadcast subdomain operations. Users would still own their
subdomain names; the registrar simply gives developers a convenient
way for them to register and manage them in the context of a
particular application.

# BNS and DID Standards

BNS names are compliant with the emerging
[Decentralized Identity Foundation](http://identity.foundation) protocol
specification for decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

Each name in BNS has an associated DID. The DID format for BNS is:

```bash
    did:stack:v0:{address}-{index}
```

Where:

- `{address}` is an on-chain public key hash (for example a Bitcoin address).
- `{index}` refers to the `nth` name this address created.

For example, the DID for `personal.id` is
`did:stack:v0:1dARRtzHPAFRNE7Yup2Md9w18XEQAtLiV-0`, because the name
`personal.id` was the first-ever name created by
`1dARRtzHPAFRNE7Yup2Md9w18XEQAtLiV`.

As another example, the DID for `jude.id` is `did:stack:v0:16EMaNw3pkn3v6f2BgnSSs53zAKH4Q8YJg-1`.
Here, the address `16EMaNw3pkn3v6f2BgnSSs53zAKH4Q8YJg` had created one earlier
name in history prior to this one (which happens to be `abcdefgh123456.id`).

The purpose of a DID is to provide an eternal identifier for a public key.
The public key may change, but the DID will not.

Stacks Blockchain implements a DID method of its own
in order to be compatible with other systems that use DIDs for public key resolution.
In order for a DID to be resolvable, all of the following must be true for a
name:

- The name must exist
- The name's zone file hash must be the hash of a well-formed DNS zone file
- The DNS zone file must be present in the Stacks node's data.
- The DNS zone file must contain a `URI` resource record that points to a signed
  JSON Web Token
- The public key that signed the JSON Web Token (and is included with it) must
  hash to the address that owns the name

Not all names will have DIDs that resolve to public keys. However, names created by standard tooling
will have DIDs that do.

A RESTful API is under development.

## DID Encoding for Subdomains

Every name and subdomain in BNS has a DID. The encoding is slightly different
for subdomains, so the software can determine which code-path to take.

- For on-chain BNS names, the `{address}` is the same as the Bitcoin address
  that owns the name. Currently, both version byte 0 and version byte 5
  addresses are supported (that is, addresses starting with `1` or `3`, meaning `p2pkh` and
  `p2sh` addresses).

- For off-chain BNS subdomains, the `{address}` has version byte 63 for
  subdomains owned by a single private key, and version byte 50 for subdomains
  owned by a m-of-n set of private keys. That is, subdomain DID addresses start
  with `S` or `M`, respectively.

The `{index}` field for a subdomain's DID is distinct from the `{index}` field
for a BNS name's DID, even if the same created both names and subdomains.
For example, the name `abcdefgh123456.id` has the DID `did:stack:v0:16EMaNw3pkn3v6f2BgnSSs53zAKH4Q8YJg-0`,
because it was the first name created by `16EMaNw3pkn3v6f2BgnSSs53zAKH4Q8YJg`.
However, `16EMaNw3pkn3v6f2BgnSSs53zAKH4Q8YJg` _also_ created `jude.statism.id`
as its first subdomain name. The DID for `jude.statism.id` is
`did:stack:v0:SSXMcDiCZ7yFSQSUj7mWzmDcdwYhq97p2i-0`. Note that the address
`SSXMcDiCZ7yFSQSUj7mWzmDcdwYhq97p2i` encodes the same public key hash as the address
`16EMaNw3pkn3v6f2BgnSSs53zAKH4Q8YJg` (the only difference between these two
strings is that the first is base58check-encoded with version byte 0, and the
second is encoded with version byte 63).
