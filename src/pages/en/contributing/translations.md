## Help with translations

Translations are managed with Crowin.  
Anybody can colaborate and no technichal skills are required, as it's all done on the browser.

To help with translation please go to [this page](https://crowdin.com/project/docsstacksco), click and language and start translating.

All help is appreciated.

Note to Github users: please don't add any translations via our GitHub repository, as the translated pages get rewritten from Crowin, so you must use this tool instead.

## Adding a language

Want to add a new language that doesn't show in Crowin? Great! Let us know!
