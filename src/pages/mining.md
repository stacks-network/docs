## Introduction

Make sure you've followed our guide for getting a Stacks 2.0 Testnet node up and running, once completed it's only a few more steps to run a proof-of-burn miner on the testnet.

## Running a miner

First, we need to generate a keychain. With this keychain, we'll get some testnet BTC from a faucet, and then use that BTC to start mining.

To get a keychain, the simplest way is to use the `blockstack-cli`. We'll use the `make_keychain` command, and pass `-t` to indicate that we want a testnet keychain.

```bash
npx blockstack-cli@1.1.0-beta.1 make_keychain -t
```

After this runs, you'll probably see some installation logs, and at the end you should see some JSON that looks like this:

```json
{
  "mnemonic": "exhaust spin topic distance hole december impulse gate century absent breeze ostrich armed clerk oak peace want scrap auction sniff cradle siren blur blur",
  "keyInfo": {
    "privateKey": "2033269b55026ff2eddaf06d2e56938f7fd8e9d697af8fe0f857bb5962894d5801",
    "address": "STTX57EGWW058FZ6WG3WS2YRBQ8HDFGBKEFBNXTF",
    "btcAddress": "mkRYR7KkPB1wjxNjVz3HByqAvVz8c4B6ND",
    "index": 0
  }
}
```

We need to get some testnet BTC to that address. Grab the `btcAddress` field, and head over to [the Stacks testnet website](https://testnet.blockstack.org/faucet). In the BTC faucet section, past in your `btcAddress`, and submit. You'll be sent 0.5 testnet BTC to that address. **Don't lose this information** - we'll need to use the `privateKey` field later on.

Now, we need to configure out node to use this Bitcoin keychain. In the `stacks-blockchain` folder, create a new file called `testnet/stacks-node/conf/testnet-miner-conf.toml`.

Paste in the following configuration:

```toml
[node]
rpc_bind = "0.0.0.0:20443"
p2p_bind = "0.0.0.0:20444"
bootstrap_node = "048dd4f26101715853533dee005f0915375854fd5be73405f679c1917a5d4d16aaaf3c4c0d7a9c132a36b8c5fe1287f07dad8c910174d789eb24bdfb5ae26f5f27@argon.blockstack.org:20444"
# Enter your private key here!
seed = "replace-with-your-private-key"
miner = true

[burnchain]
chain = "bitcoin"
mode = "argon"
peer_host = "argon.blockstack.org"
rpc_port = 18443
peer_port = 18444

[[mstx_balance]]
address = "STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6"
amount = 10000000000000000
[[mstx_balance]]
address = "ST11NJTTKGVT6D1HY4NJRVQWMQM7TVAR091EJ8P2Y"
amount = 10000000000000000
[[mstx_balance]]
address = "ST1HB1T8WRNBYB0Y3T7WXZS38NKKPTBR3EG9EPJKR"
amount = 10000000000000000
[[mstx_balance]]
address = "STRYYQQ9M8KAF4NS7WNZQYY59X93XEKR31JP64CP"
amount = 10000000000000000
```

Now, grab your `privateKey` from earlier, when you ran the `make_keychain` command. Replace the `seed` field with your private key. Save and close this configuration file.

To run your miner, run this in the command line:

```bash
stacks-node start --config=./testnet/stacks-node/conf/testnet-miner-conf.toml
```

Your node should start. It will take some time to sync, and then your miner will be running!

### Creating an optimized binary

The steps above are great for trying to run a node temporarily. If you want to host a node on a server somewhere, you might want to generate an optimized binary. To do so, use the same configuration as above, but run:

```bash
cd testnet/stacks-node
cargo build --release --bin stacks-node
```

The above code will compile an optimized binary. To use it, run:

```bash
cd ../..
./target/release/stacks-node start --config=./testnet/conf/argon-follower-conf.toml
```

## Enable debug logging

In case you are running into issues or would like to see verbose logging, you can run your node with debug logging enabled. In the command line, run:

```bash
BLOCKSTACK_DEBUG=1 stacks-node argon
```
