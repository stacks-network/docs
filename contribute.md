# Contribute

### Contribute to Stacks Core

There is a [detailed contribution guide](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that lives in the Stacks core GitHub repository that is the best place to get started contributing to Stacks.

### Contribute to these Docs

The Stacks docs are built using GitBook with a two-way sync with the [docs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/stacks-network/docs).

Because of this two-way sync, you can contribute to the documentation in one of two ways:

1. You can fork the docs repo, add your change, and then create a PR to be merged into the main docs
2. You can create an issue, and someone that works on the docs will take a look and implement it if it is a necessary change

What kinds of changes are we looking for?

If you see a typo, a missing tutorial, an unclear explanation, or really anything else you think could improve the quality of the documentation, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
