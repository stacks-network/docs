# Core Features of sBTC

sBTC offers several core features that make it a powerful trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge between Stacks and Bitcoin:

## 1. 1:1 Bitcoin Backing

Each sBTC token is backed by an equivalent amount of Bitcoin in the peg wallet. This ensures that sBTC maintains a stable value relative to BTC.

## 2. Decentralized Management

The sBTC peg wallet is maintained and managed by a set of sBTC signers. This decentralized approach enhances security and reduces single points of failure.

## 3. Quick Conversions

sBTC facilitates rapid movement between BTC and sBTC:

- BTC to sBTC conversion can be completed within 3 Bitcoin blocks
- sBTC to BTC conversion can be completed within 6 Bitcoin blocks

## 4. SIP-010 Compatibility

sBTC adheres to the SIP-010 fungible token standard on the Stacks blockchain. This ensures wide compatibility with Stacks wallets and applications.

## 5. Community Governance

The initial sBTC signing set is determined by a community vote, weighted by STX holdings. This approach ensures that the community has a say in the management of the sBTC system.

## 6. Signer Key Rotation

sBTC signers have the ability to rotate their private keys, enhancing long-term security of the system.

## 7. Transaction Fee Sponsorship

sBTC transactions on Stacks can be sponsored, allowing users to pay transaction fees in sBTC instead of STX.

These core features work together to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly bridge between Bitcoin and the Stacks ecosystem. Let's dig into each of these features.
