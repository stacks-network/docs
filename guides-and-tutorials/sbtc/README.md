The guides in this section provide step-by-step instructions for interacting
with sBTC, including operating as a signer and (coming soon) developer guides on

Note that in order to run a sBTC signer you must be one of the [approved
signers](https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc/discussions/624) described in
[SIP-028](https://github.com/andrerserrano/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-028/sip-028-sbtc_peg.md).
