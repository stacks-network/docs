The guides in this section provide step-by-step instructions for interacting with sBTC, including operating as a signer and (coming soon) developer guides on how to interact with sBTC as an application developer.

Note that in sBTC V1, in order to run a sBTC signer you must be one of the [approved signers](https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc/discussions/624). In sBTC V2, the approved signers selected according to the process described in [SIP-028](https://github.com/andrerserrano/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-028/sip-028-sbtc_peg.md).
