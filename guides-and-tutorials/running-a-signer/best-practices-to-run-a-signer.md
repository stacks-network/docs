# Best practices for running a Signer

{% hint style="info" %}
**Intended audience**: solo Stackers or Stacking pool operators.

The following best practices suggest how to create a resilient setup for running your Signer.

{% hint style="info" %}
tl;dr: avoid single point of failures, introduce redundancy, monitor things.

### Monitor your Signer and collect logs

- See
  [here](https://www.notion.so/guides-and-tutorials/running-a-signer/how-to-monitor-signer.md)
  on how to set up monitoring.
- Retain at least 1 week of logs for both the Signer and the Stacks node.

### Downstream components

- Run a *dedicated* Bitcoin node and Stacks node per Signer.
    - Ensure the nodes are provisioned with the minimum hardware requirements
      described
      [here](https://docs.stacks.co/guides-and-tutorials/running-a-signer#minimum-system-requirements).
    - Nodes should be *exclusively dedicated* to serve the Signer. Avoid
      re-using them to serve other clients as that may negatively affect
      performance (no *mock-signing*, no *Stacks API nodes*).
- If running dedicated nodes is not possible, then ensure that the Bitcoin /
  Stacks nodes do not become single point of failures for *multiple* signers
  depending on them.
    - Introduce redundancy, load balancing, rely on a robust Bitcoin RPC
      provider, etc.

### Split voting power across multiple Signers

- Distribute your voting power across multiple, distinct Signer public keys to
  mitigate the risk of loss or downtime from a single compromised key.
- Each Signer should also limit voting power to a maximum amount and invite
  Stackers to use a different Signer when the limit is reached.

### Monitor new software releases

- Stay up-to-date with new releases, patches, and security advisories (e.g.,
  GitHub, mailing lists, Discord).
- Apply updates as quickly as possible, especially those addressing a security
  vulnerability.

### Upgrade procedures

- Upgrading one Signer instance at the time.
- Test the update on one instance and, if successful, proceed to the others.
- While your Signer is offline for upgrades, it won't sign any blocks. Ensure
  that the downtime is as short as possible.

### Diversified hosting

- Use different provider / configuration where feasible (e.g., a self-hosted
  instance and one in the cloud, or in two different data center regions, etc.).
- Ensure each host has redundant power supply and network connectivity.

### Fall-back deployments

- Deploy additional Stacks nodes and Bitcoin nodes to be used as fall-back.
  - Use the same configuration as your _active_ instances.
  - For the Stacks node, comment out the `event_observer` section.
- Prepare a backup Signer (same configuration) to be quickly activated, but _do
  not run it_.
  - At all times, there should be _exactly_ one Signer instance running for each
    Signer private key.
- These instances should be hosted on separate physical hosts (see *diversified
  hosting*) from the instances usually active in operations (serving each
  Signer).
- If an active instance (e.g., the Signer, the Stacks node or the Bitcoin node)
  fails, you can quickly switch to the fall-back configuration to continue
  operations. To do that:
  - Run the backup Signer.
  - Enable the `event_observer` section of the Node configuration.
  - Restart the node.

### Redundancy in operations

- Ensure that multiple, trusted users can manage and maintain signer instances.
- Where feasible, users should span different timezones.

### Backup signer keys in cold-storage

- Keep an offline, secure backup of all Signer private keys (e.g., hardware
  security modules or encrypted storage devices).
