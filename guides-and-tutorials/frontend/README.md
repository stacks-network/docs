# Build a Frontend

A major part of building full-stack Stacks applications will involve building out a UI with a solid user experience. One of your primary tools in accomplishing this will be Stacks.js, a JavaScript library built by Hiro to make working with contracts and the chain itself easier.

Hiro has excellent documentation in place to help you utilize Stacks.js to build out a great frontend to your Clarity contracts.
