# How to Participate as a Stacker

Participating as a Stacker in the Stacks Blockchain is an essential role to ensure the liveliness of sBTC. To become a Stacker, you must hold and temporarily lock STX, Stacks’ native currency, and support the network’s security and consensus. As a reward, you earn BTC.

There are multiple ways for you to stack and earn Bitcoin - either through an exchange, a non-custodial stacking service, or independently. The most appropriate choice depends on your crypto experience and the amount of STX you have at your disposal. For direct participation, Stacks holders need a dynamic minimum amount of STX (approximately 100,000k STX during the mainnet, but this amount fluctuates based on overall participation and supply. See the [`pox` endpoint](https://docs.hiro.so/api#tag/Info/operation/get\_pox\_info) of the Hiro API to get the minimum of the next cycle). If you don't meet this minimum, you can still participate by leveraging third-party Stacking delegation services. These services combine your holdings with others, allowing joint participation. A complete breakdown of the stacking mechanism can be found in [SIP-007](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-007/sip-007-stacking-consensus.md).
