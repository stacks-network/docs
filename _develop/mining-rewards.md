# How payouts are administered

The payouts are administered by Blockstack PBC and facilitated by App.co. Here is how the payouts ramp: 

<div class="uk-overflow-auto">
<table class="uk-table uk-table-small uk-table-striped">
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Rewards Period</th>
         <th>Rewards Pool</th>
         <th>Reward Share</th>
         <th>Total Monthly Bonus Award for the 10 Highest Rated New Apps</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>August 2019 - October 2019</td>
         <td>$200,000 ($100,000 in BTC* <em> and $100,000 in Stacks tokens**</em>)</td>
         <td>20% of the remaining BTC payout for each sequentially ranked app + 3% of the remaining STX payout for each sequentially ranked app</td>
         <td>$10,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>November 2019 - January 2020</td>
         <td>$500,000 in Stacks tokens</td>
         <td>5% of the remaining STX payout for each sequentially ranked app</td>
         <td>$50,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>February 2020 - April 2020</td>
         <td>$700,000 in Stacks tokens</td>
         <td>4% of the remaining STX payout for each sequentially ranked app</td>
         <td>$70,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>May 2020 - October 2020</td>
         <td>$1,000,000 in Stacks tokens</td>
         <td>3% of the remaining STX payout for each sequentially ranked app</td>
         <td>$100,000</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>

<h5>Table notes</h5>
<div class="uk-text-small">
<p>* The value of BTC will be based on market value at the time of the payout.</p>
<p>** The price of the Stacks Tokens distributed under the App Mining program in exchange for non-cash consideration will be deemed to be $0.30 per token for at least three months from the first distribution of tokens pursuant to this offering circular, for purposes of determining whether over $40,000,000 of Stacks Tokens have been sold under this offering.</p>
<p>
If at any time following that three-month period the Stacks Tokens are traded on one or more authorized exchanges or alternative trading systems, and there are trades for at least one million Stacks Tokens executed through or on exchanges or alternative trading systems during any calendar month (any such month, a <q>calculationmonth</q>), then we will value the tokens paid to developers in the following month and in all subsequent months until and including the end of the next calculation month at the average closing bid price for the tokens during the calculation month. 
</p>
<p>
We will disclose both any changes to the price of the Stacks Tokens to be distributed pursuant to this offering circular, and whether the new calculation price will result in a curtailment of the number of Stacks Tokens being issued in the next month, using either an offering circular supplement filed under Rule 253(g)(2) or a post-qualification amendment, depending on the facts and circumstances at the time of such change.
