<p>This tutorial was extensively tested using Android Studio 3.1 on a MacBook Air
running High Sierra 10.13.4. If your environment is different, you may encounter
slight or even major discrepancies when performing the procedures in this
tutorial. Please <a href="https://slofile.com/slack/blockstack">join the Blockstack community
Slack</a> and post questions or comments to
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#support</code> channel.</p>

<p>Finally, this tutorial is written for all levels from the beginner to the most
experienced. For best results, beginners should follow the guide as written. It
is expected that the fast or furiously brilliant will skip ahead and improvise
on this material at will. Fair journey one and all.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can skip working through the tutorial all together. Instead,
you can <a href="images/helloandroid.zip">download the final project code</a> and import it
into Android Studio to review it.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-sample-application-flow">Understand the sample application flow</h2>

<p>When complete, the sample application is a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> display. It is
intended for user on an Android phone.</p>

<p><img src="images/final-app.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Only users with an existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.id</code> can run your
final sample application. When complete, users interact with the sample
application by doing the following:</p>

<p><img src="images/app-flow.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-environment">Set up your environment</h2>

<p>This sample application has two code bases, a Blockstack <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code>
application and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-andriod</code> Android application. Before you start
developing the sample, there are a few elements you need in your environment.</p>

<h3 id="install-android-studio">Install Android Studio</h3>

<p>If you are an experienced Android developer and already have an Android
development environment on your workstation, you can use that and skip this
step. However, you will need to adjust the remaining instructions for your
environment.</p>

<p>Follow the installation instructions to download and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">Android Studio
3.1</a> for your operating system.
Depending on your network connection, this can take between 15-30 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="images/studio-download.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-npm">Do you have npm?</h3>

<p>The Blockstack code in this tutorial relies on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> dependency manager.
Before you begin, verify you have installed <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">which</code> command to
verify.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>which npm
/usr/local/bin/npm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you don’t find <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> in your system, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">install
it</a>.</p>

<h3 id="install-the-blockstack-test-rig">Install the Blockstack test rig</h3>

<p>Users interact with Blockstack-enabled applications through a web browser. You
can Blockstack in test mode, on <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> or you can interact with completed
apps through the Blockstack webapp which is available at
[https://browser.blockstack.org/].</p>

<p>If you have already installed Blockstack for testing locally and have an
existing Blockstack ID, skip this section.  Otherwise, continue onto install
Blockstack.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to  <a href="https://blockstack.org/install">Blockstack</a></p>

    <p><img src="images/blockstack-install.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install the version appropriate for your operating system.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="use-npm-to-install-yeoman-and-the-blockstack-app-generator">Use npm to install Yeoman and the Blockstack App Generator</h3>

<p>You use <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> to install Yeoman. Yeoman is a generic scaffolding system that
helps users rapidly start new projects and streamline the maintenance of
existing projects.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install Yeoman.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> npm install <span class="nt">-g</span> yo
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install the Blockstack application generator.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> npm install <span class="nt">-g</span> generator-blockstack
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="build-the-blockstack-hello-world">Build the Blockstack hello-world</h2>

<p>In this section, you build a Blockstack <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> application. Then, you
modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> to interact with the Android app via a redirect.</p>

<h3 id="generate-and-launch-your-hello-blockstack-application">Generate and launch your hello-blockstack application</h3>

<p>In this section, you build an initial React.js application called
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code> directory.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> mkdir hello-blockstack
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change into your new directory.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nb">cd </span>hello-blockstack
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Yeoman and the Blockstack application generator to create your initial <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code> application.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> yo blockstack:react
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>You should see several interactive prompts.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>yo blockstack:react

<p>When a user opens the webapp from the Blockstack browser on an Android phone,
you want the web app to redirect the user to your Android application. The work

  <li>
    <p>From the terminal command line, change directory to the root of your sample
application directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">touch</code> command to add a redirect endpoint to your application.</p>

    <p>This endpoint on the web version of your app will redirect Android users back

    <p>Blockstack apps are identified by their domain names.  The endpoint will
 receive a get request with the query parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">authResponse=XXXX</code> and
 should redirect the browser to <code class="highlighter-rouge">myblockstackapp:XXXX</code>.</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">myblockstackapp:</code> is custom protocol handler. The handler should be unique
 to your application. Your app’s web-based authentication uses this handler
 to redirect the user back to your Android app. Later, you’ll add a reference
 to this handler in your Android application.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-simple-project">Create a simple project</h3>

<p>In this section, you create an inital project. You’ll validate the application’s
iniatial state by creating an emulator to run it in. Open Android Studio and do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open Android Studio and choose <strong>Start a new Andriod Studio project</strong>.</p>

    <p>If studio is already started, choose <strong>File &gt; New &gt; New Project</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="run-the-app-in-an-emulator">Run the app in an emulator</h3>

<p>In this section, you run the appliation and create an emulator when prompted.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Once the project is imported into studio, click the <code class="highlighter-rouge">app</code> module in the <strong>Project</strong> window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, select <strong>Run &gt; Run</strong> (or click the green arrow  in the toolbar).</p>

    <p>Studio prompts you to <strong>Select Deployment Target</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose <strong>Create New Virtual Device</strong> and press <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

    <p>Studio prompts you to <strong>Select Hardware</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that you have created your initial project and verified it running in an emulator, you are ready to begin configuring the application for use with Blockstack.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In studio, open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code> file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the a <code class="highlighter-rouge">launchMode</code> to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.MainActivity</code> definition.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-XML"> &lt;activity android:name=".MainActivity" android:launchMode="singleTask"&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>Blockstack requires that the activity that starts the sign-in process also
handles the auth reponse token. This means that the activity needs to run in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">singleTask</code> launch mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add an <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</code> with the custom handler for Blockstack.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Open the Project’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the Jitpack repository <code class="highlighter-rouge">maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }</code> to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">repositories</code> section.</p>

    <p>This new <code class="highlighter-rouge">onCreate</code> does several things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Define the initial state for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">signInButton</code>.</li>
      <li>Supply authentication information for connecting to your Blockstack app: <code class="highlighter-rouge">appDomain</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">redirectURI</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">manifestURI</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">scopes</code></li>
      <li>Add a listener for the button click.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notice that the application in this example is a URI you have not set up.
 Registering and application name takes time, so in time’s interest you’ll
 use an existing app that is identical to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> you created
 earlier. For a produciton verison, you’ll need to replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">appDomain</code>,
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">redirectURI</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">manifestURI</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">scopes</code> with values appropriate for your
 app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a private function to reflect when a user successfully signs in.</p>
