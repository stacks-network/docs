<p>In this tutorial, you build the code for and run a single-page application (SPA)
with Blockstack and Vue.js. Once the application is running, you take a tour
through the applications’ Blockstack functionality. You’ll learn how it manages
authentiation using a Blockstack ID and how it stores information associated
with that ID using Blockstack Storage (Gaia).</p>

<h2 id="about-this-tutorial-and-the-prerequisites-you-need">About this tutorial and the prerequisites you need</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we will use the following tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> to manage dependencies and scripts</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">browserify</code> to compile node code into browser-ready code</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.js</code> to authenticate the user and work with the user’s identity/profile information</li>
</ul>

<p>At minimum, Blockstack requires macOS High Sierra. This tutorial was written for a user running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4. The application you build is a React.js application that is completely decentralized and server-less. While not strictly required to follow along, basic familiarity with React.js is helpful.</p>

<p>When complete, the app is capable of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>authenticating users using Blockstack</li>
  <li>posting new statuses</li>
  <li>displaying statuses in the user profile</li>
  <li>looking up the profiles and statuses of other users</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic identity and storage services are provided by blockstack.js. To test the application, you need to have already registered a Blockstack ID.</p>

<p>The tutorial relies on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> dependency manager. Before you begin, verify you have installed <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">which</code> command to verify.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>which npm
/usr/local/bin/npm
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you don’t find <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> in your system, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">install it</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure you have <a href="{site.baseurl}}/browser/ids-introduction.html#create-an-initial-blockstack-id">created at least one Blockstack ID</a>.
You’ll use this ID to interact with the application.</p>

<h2 id="install-the-application-code-and-retrieve-the-dependencies">Install the application code and retrieve the dependencies</h2>

<p>You can clone the source code with  <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> or <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-todos/archive/master.zip">download and unzip the code from
the
repository</a>.
These instructions assume you are cloning.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install the code by cloning it.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> $ git clone git@github.com:blockstack/blockstack-todos.git
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change to directory to the root of the code.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> $ cd blockstack-todos
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">yarn</code> to install the dependencies.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> $ yarn install

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Todo application has a basic Vue.js structure. There are several configuration files but the central programming files are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">src</code> directory:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">main.js</code></td>
      <td>Application initialization.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">App.vue </code></td>
      <td>Code for handling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authResponse</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Landing.vue </code></td>
      <td>Code for the initial sign on page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Dashboard.vue</code></td>
      <td>Application data storage and user sign out.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="sign-into-the-application">Sign into the application</h2>

<p>The example application runs in a node server on your local host. In the this section, you start the application and interact with it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you are in the root of the code base.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">pwd</span> /Users/moxiegirl/repos/blockstack-todos
 Start the application.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start the application.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> $ npm run start
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>You should see a simple application:</p>

    <p><img src="images/todo-sign-in.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose <strong>Sign In with Blockstack</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you have already signed into Blockstack the application prompts you to select the ID to use. If you aren’t signed in, Blockstack prompts you to:</p>

    <p><img src="images/login-choice.png" alt="" /></p>

    <p>If the login to the application is successful, the user is presented with the application:</p>

    <p><img src="images/todo-app.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="understand-the-sign-in-process">Understand the sign in process</h2>

<p>Clicking the Sign In With Blockstack button brings up a modal that prompts you
to sign in with an existing ID or create a new ID. When Blockstack is provided
an ID, it generates an ephemeral key within the application. An ephemeral key is
generated for each execution of a key establishment process. This key is just
used for the particular instance of the application, in this case to sign a Sign
In request.</p>

<p>A Blockstack Core node also generates a public key token which is sent to the
browser as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">authRequest</code> from the browser to your core node. The signed
authentication request is sent to Blockstack through a JSON Web Token (JWT).
Blocktack passes the token in via a URL query string in the authRequest
parameter:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">https://browser.blockstack.org/auth?authRequest=j902120cn829n1jnvoa...</code></p>

<p>To decode the token and see what information it holds:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authRequest</code> string from the URL.</li>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Paste the full token there.</p>

    <p>The output should look similar to below:</p>

    <div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">iss</code> property is a decentralized identifier or <code class="highlighter-rouge">did</code>. This identifies you and your name to the application. The specific <code class="highlighter-rouge">did</code> is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">btc-addr</code>.</li>
        <li>The Blockstack JWT implementation is different from other implementations because of the underlying cryptography we employ. There are libraries in <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/jsontokens-js">Javascript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/ruby-jwt-blockstack">Ruby</a> available on the Blockstack Github to allow you to work with these tokens.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When the Blockstack node receives the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authRequest</code>, it generates a session token
and returns an authentication response to the application. This response is
similar to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authRequest</code> above in that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authResponse</code> includes a private key
intended only for the application. This allows the application to encrypt data
on your personal Blockstack storage.</p>

<p>After the completion of this process, the user is logged in.</p>

<h2 id="undder-the-covers-in-the-sign-in-code">Undder the covers in the sign in code</h2>

<p>Now, go to the underlying <code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack-todo</code> code you cloned or downloaded. Sign
in and sign out is handled in each of these files:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">App.vue </code></td>
      <td>Handles the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authResponse</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Landing.vue </code></td>
      <td>Generates the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authRequest</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Dashboard.vue</code></td>
      <td>Handles sign out.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/Landing.vue</code> code calls a <a href="https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack.js#redirectToSignIn"><code class="highlighter-rouge">redirectToSignIn()</code></a> function which generates the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authRequest</code> and redirects the user to the Blockstack authenticator:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">signIn</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">blockstack</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">blockstack</span>
  <span class="nx">blockstack</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">redirectToSignIn</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the user authenticates, the application handles the <code class="highlighter-rouge">authResponse</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/App.vue</code> file. :</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">blockstack</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">isUserSignedIn</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="nx">blockstack</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">handlePendingSignIn</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">then</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">userData</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">})</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <a href="https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack.js/#isusersignedin"><code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.isUserSignedIn()</code></a> is true, the user was previously signed in so Blockstack pulls the data from the browser and uses it in our application. If the check on  <a href="https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack.js/#issigninpending"><code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.isSignInPending()</code></a> is true, a previous <code class="highlighter-rouge">authResponse</code> was sent to the application but hasn’t been processed yet. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">handlePendingSignIn()</code> function processes any pending sign in.</p>

<p>Signout is handled in <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/Dashboard.vue</code>.</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">signOut</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">blockstack</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">signUserOut</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The method allows the application creator to decide where to redirect the user upon Sign Out:</p>

<h2 id="working-with-the-application">Working with the application</h2>

<p>Now, trying adding a few itmes to the todo list. For example, try making a list of applications you want to see built on top of Blockstack:</p>

<p><img src="images/make-a-list.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each list is immediately stored in the Gaia Hub linked to your Blockstack ID.
For more information about the Gaia hub, see the <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/gaia">hub
repository</a>. You can fetch the <code class="highlighter-rouge">todos.json</code>
file you just added by opening the Javascript console and running the following
command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Javascript">blockstack.getFile("todos.json", { decrypt: true }).then((file) =&gt; {console.log(file)})
</code></pre>

<p>You should see a JSON with the todos you just added:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add another todo and check it off. When you fetch the newly generated file
using the Javascript console, the results reflect your change. Look for <code class="highlighter-rouge">"completed":true</code>:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">

<p>Now that you have seen the application in action, dig into how it works.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-storage">Implementing storage</h2>

<p>Go to the underlying <code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack-todo</code> code you cloned or downloaded. The
application interactions with your Gaia Hub originate in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/Dashboard.vue</code> file. First, examine where the changes to the
Todos are processed:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">todos</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">blockstack</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">blockstack</span>

  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="nx">deep</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">todos</code> JSON object is passed in and the
<a href="https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack.js/#putfile"><code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.putFile()</code></a>
method to store it in a Gaia Hub.</p>

<p>The code needs to read the Todo items from the storage with the <a href="https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack.js/#getfile"><code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.getFile()</code></a> method which returns a promise:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">fetchData</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">todos</code> data is retrieved from the promise.</p>

<p>You now have everything you need to construct complex applications complete with authentication and storage on the Decentralized Internet. Why not try coding <a href="multi-player-storage.md">a sample application that accesses multiple profiles</a>.</p>
