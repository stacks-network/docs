</tr>

<tr>
    <th>blockchain</th>
    <td>A database created and shared by the members of a peer-to-peer computer network which each member of that network can independently trust due to the rules governing the database’s creation. A blockchain can therefore be used to replace centralized databases.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
    <th>blockstack id</th>
    <td>See id.blockstack</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>Burning</th>
    <td>Burning a token means that the token is transferred to an address that is a black hole—one that is not owned by any entity and for which guessing the applicable private key is effectively impossible based on known mathematical principles. This effectively destroys the token by making it unavailable for future use and decreases the total number of tokens available from that point forward.</td>
</tr>

</tr>

<tr>
    <th>digital fingerprint</th>
    <td>A digital fingerprint is a unique number of a fixed length that can be produced by running any set of digital information through something called a cryptographic hash function. Each set of digital information (including a digital asset, and the digital record of any network operation on that digital asset) should (as a practical matter) have a unique digital fingerprint, which allows that set of digital information to be identified. However, it is almost impossible to recreate a digital asset from its digital fingerprint. The Blockstack network uses industry-standard algorithms such as SHA-256 to create digital fingerprints.</td>

    <td>A cryptographic key is called ephemeral if it is generated for each execution of a key establishment process.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>fork</th>
    <td>The term fork is used to refer both to any situation where there are two or more competing versions of a blockchain on a network (a situation that may arise and resolve itself in the ordinary course of network operations due to lags in communication between core nodes) and any software update that is proposed for adoption by the core nodes of a blockchain network that may result in a persistent fork on the network, with core nodes that adopt the update recognizing one version of the blockchain and those which do not recognizing another.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
    <th>mining</th>
    <td>Mining generally refers to the process of performing certain functions for a network such as adding new records to a blockchain in exchange for mining rewards; it may also refer to other mechanisms whereby rewards (usually in the form of cryptocurrency) are provided for performing other tasks helpful to the network.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>mining power</th>
    <td>A miner’s (or group of miners’) mining power is equal to the probability it will be selected to write a new block to the blockchain. Depending on the mechanism for mining, this is usually related to the overall share of computing power or cryptoassets the miner or miners possess relative to all miners for that blockchain.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>mining rewards</th>
    <td>Mining rewards are newly issued tokens received by miners in exchange for adding new records to the blockchain or other activities beneficial to the network.</td>
</tr>

<tr>

</tr>

<tr>
    <th>network operation</th>
    <td>A network operation is any change to the information about a digital asset (or smart contract) stored on a blockchain, including, for example, a change in the digital asset’s owner, or a change in the location at which it is stored on the network. How and when these network operations are performed for each digital asset is governed, on the Blockstack network, either by the Blockstack Core software or a smart contract.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</th>
    <td>A system which returns a cryptographic public key associated with a name.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>private key</th>
    <td>A private key is a very large random sequence of digital information (effectively a very long password) that should be known only by a single user of the network and cannot be plausibly guessed by a third party in a reasonable amount of time. A user generates this large random sequence locally on a computer and should never share it with anyone. Each private key has a paired sequence of digital information, called a public key, which a user can share publicly.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>proof-of-burn mining</th>
    <td>The consensus algorithm used in the Stacks blockchain where miners destroy a proof-of-work-based cryptocurrency (currently Bitcoin) to get tokens; this enables the functionality where nodes can select between conflicting blockchain forks, as the blockchain fork with the most amount of cryptocurrency burned is considered to be the correct fork.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>proof-of-work</th>
    <td>A proof-of-work system or proof-of-work mining is a mining mechanism where miners must expend computing power to solve complicated cryptographic puzzles, and prove that they have done so by writing the solution to the blockchain, in order to be allowed to add blocks to a blockchain.

</tr>

<tr>
    <th>replicated state machines (RSMs)</th>
    <td>This is a model for reasoning about distributed computer programs -- any program (plus it's input) can be represented as a state machine, and when trying to get a distributed set of servers to agree on the output of an algorithm, you can model that process as N different state machines</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>smart contract</th>
    <td>A smart contract is a computer program written to a blockchain such as the Blockstack blockchain by developers. This computer program defines the various network operations that can be performed on the digital assets on the blockchain, the computations that can be performed using the smart contract, along with defining various important properties of the respective digital assets like ownership rights and the cost in fuel required to register the digital assets.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>soft fork</th>
    <td>A soft fork is a proposed update to the software governing the network that results in a post-update network that is compatible with the network as it existed prior to the update, because it restricts the network operations that can be performed after the update.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>Stacks blockchain</th>
    <td>The Stacks blockchain is the custom blockchain being developed for use by the Blockstack network that will use the Stacks token as its native currency and which will include the genesis block and subsequent blocks created by the mining activities described in The Blockstack Network—Development of the Blockstack network.</td>
</tr>
