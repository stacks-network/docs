<p>This tutorial does not teach you about authentication. That is covered in depth <a href="hello-blockstack">in the hello-blockstack tutorial</a>.</p>

<!--TODO: authentication tutorial-->
<!--Strictly speaking not sure it is necessary here to send them out-->

<h2 id="about-this-tutorial-and-the-prerequisites-you-need">About this tutorial and the prerequisites you need</h2>

<p>At minimum, Blockstack requires macOS High Sierra. This tutorial was written for
a user running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4. The application you build is a
React.js application that is completely decentralized and server-less.  While
not strictly required to follow along, basic familiarity with React.js is
helpful.</p>

<p>When complete, the app is capable of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>authenticating users using Blockstack</li>
  <li>posting new statuses</li>
  <li>displaying statuses in the user profile</li>
  <li>looking up the profiles and statuses of other users</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic identity and storage services are provided by <code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.js</code>. To test
the application, you need to have already <a href="ids-introduction">registered a Blockstack ID</a>.</p>

<p>The tutorial relies on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> dependency manager. Before you begin, verify
you have installed <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">which</code> command.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>which npm
/usr/local/bin/npm
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you don’t find <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> in your system, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">install
it</a>. Finally, if you get stuck at any point
while working on the tutorial, the completed <a href="https://github.com/larrysalibra/publik">source code is available for
you</a> to check your work against.</p>

<h2 id="use-npm-to-install-yeoman-and-the-blockstack-app-generator">Use npm to install Yeoman and the Blockstack App Generator</h2>

<p>You use <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> to install Yeoman. Yeoman is a generic scaffolding system that
helps users rapidly start new projects and streamline the maintenance of
existing projects.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install Yeoman.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> npm install -g yo
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install the Blockstack application generator.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> npm install -g generator-blockstack
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Need to find out if user is required to have React installed before running Yeoman. Doesn't appear to be the case. -->

<h2 id="generate-and-launch-the-public-application">Generate and launch the public application</h2>

<p>In this section, you build an initial React.js application called Publik.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a the <code class="highlighter-rouge">publik</code> directory.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> mkdir publik
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change into your new directory.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nb">cd </span>publik
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Yeoman and the Blockstack application generator to create your initial <code class="highlighter-rouge">publik</code> application.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> yo blockstack:react
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You should see several interactive prompts.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>yo blockstack:react

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respond to the prompts to populate the initial app.</p>

    <p>After the process completes successfully, you see a prompt similar to the following:</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="o">[</span>fsevents] Success:

  <li>
    <p>Run the initial application.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> npm start

    </div>

    <p>The system prompts you to accept incoming connections.</p>

    <p><img src="./images/network-connections.gif" alt="Network Connection" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose <strong>Allow</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open your browser to <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

    <p>You should see a simple React app.</p>

    <p><img src="images/initial-app.gif" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose <strong>Sign In with Blockstack</strong>.</p>

    <p>The application tells you it will <strong>Read your basic info</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="images/login.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Leave your new application running and move onto the next section.</p>

<h2 id="add-the-publish_data-scope-to-sign-in-requests">Add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">publish_data</code> scope to sign in requests</h2>

<p>Every app that uses Gaia storage must add itself to the user’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">profile.json</code>
file. The Blockstack browser does this automatically when the <code class="highlighter-rouge">publish_data</code>
scope is requested during authentication. For this application, the user files
stored on Gaia are made visible to others via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apps</code> property in the user’s
<code class="highlighter-rouge">profile.json</code> file.</p>

<p>Modify your authentication request to include the <code class="highlighter-rouge">publish_data</code> scope.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/App.jsx</code> file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Locate the <code class="highlighter-rouge">handleSignIn</code> handler method.</p>

    <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nx">handleSignIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">preventDefault</span><span class="p">();</span>
   <span class="nx">redirectToSignIn</span><span class="p">();</span>
 <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modify the method to this:</p>

    <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nx">handleSignIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">preventDefault</span><span class="p">();</span>
   <span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">origin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">origin</span>
   <span class="nx">redirectToSignIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">origin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">origin</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'/manifest.json'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'store_write'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'publish_data'</span><span class="p">])</span>
 <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>By default, authentication requests include the <code class="highlighter-rouge">store_write</code> scope which
 enables storage. This is what allows you to store information to Gaia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Save your changes.</li>
  <li>Go back to your app at <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8080/</code>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Log out and sign in again.</p>

    <p>The authentication request now prompts the user for permission to <strong>Publish
 data stored for the app</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="images/publish-data-perm.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="understand-gaia-storage-methods">Understand Gaia storage methods</h2>

<p>Once you authenticate a user with <code class="highlighter-rouge">store_write</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">publish_data</code>, you can
begin to manage data for your users. Blockstack JS provides two methods
<code class="highlighter-rouge">getFile()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">putFile()</code> for interacting with Gaia storage. The storage
methods support all file types. This means you can store SQL, Markdown, JSON, or
even a custom format.</p>

<p>You can create a meaningful and complex data layer using these two methods.
Before creating an application, consider fundamental data architecture and make
some decisions about how you’re modeling data. For example, consider building a
simple grocery list app. A user should be able to create, read, update, and
delete grocery lists.</p>

<p>A single file collection stores items as an array nested inside each grocery
list:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// grocerylists.json</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"3255"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"items"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
      <span class="s2">"1 Head of Lettuce"</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="s2">"Haralson apples"</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="c1">// ...more lists with items</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is conceptually the simplest way to manage grocery lists. When you read a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/grocerylists.json</code> file with <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFile()</code>, you get back one or more grocery
lists and their items. When you write a single list, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">putFile()</code> method
overwrites the entire list. So, a write operation for a new or updated grocery
list must submit all existings lists as well.</p>

<p>Further, because this runs on the client where anything can go wrong. If the
client-side code encounters a parsing error with a user-input value and you
could overwrite the entire file with:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">line 6: Parsing Error: Unexpected token.</code></p>

<p>Further, a single file makes pagination impossible and if your app stores a
single file for all list you have less control over file permissions. To avoid
these issues, you can create an index file that stores an array of IDs. These
IDs point to a name of another file in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">grocerylists</code> folder.</p>

<p><img src="images/multiple-lists.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This design allows you to get only the files you need and avoid accidentally
overwriting all lists. Further, you’re only updating the index file when you add
or remove a grocery list; updating a list has no impact.</p>

<h2 id="add-support-for-user-status-submission-and-lookup">Add support for user status submission and lookup</h2>

<p>In this step, you add three <code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.js</code> methods that support posting of “statuses”. These are the <code class="highlighter-rouge">putFile()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFile()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">lookupProfile()</code> methods.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/Profile.jsx</code> file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expand the <code class="highlighter-rouge">import from blockstack</code> statement with data methods.</p>

    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> object holds a Blockstack profile. Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">putFile</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFile</code>,
 and <code class="highlighter-rouge">lookupProfile</code> after <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> When you are done, the import statement should look like the following:

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Replace the <code class="highlighter-rouge">constructor()</code> initial state so that it holds the key properties required by the app.</p>

    <p>This code constructs a Blockstack <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> object to hold the profile. Your constructor should look like this:</p>

    <p>Save and close the <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/styles/style.css</code> file.</p>

    <p>After the application compiles, you should see the following:</p>

    <p><img src="images/multi-player-storage-status.png" alt="Multi-reader storage authentication" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you have a basic micro-blogging app that users can use to post and
view statuses. However, there’s no way to view other users’ statuses. You’ll add
that in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="lookup-user-profiles">Lookup user profiles</h2>

<p>Let’s now modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Profile.jsx</code> file to display profiles of other users. You’ll
be using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lookupProfile()</code> method that you added to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">import</code> statement
earlier. <code class="highlighter-rouge">lookupProfile()</code> takes a single parameter that is the Blockstack ID of
the profile and returns a profile object.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-new-route">Add a new route</h3>

<p>Make some changes to the routing structure of your app so that users can view
other users’ profiles by visiting <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8080/other_user.id</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you are in the root of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">publik</code> project.</li>

  <li>Edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/index.js</code> file.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ReactDOM.render()</code> method in <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/index.js</code> to:</p>

  <li>Edit the  <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/App.jsx</code> file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the new route by importing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Switch</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Route</code> components from <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-router-dom</code>:</p>

    <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="kr">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">Switch</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Route</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="s1">'react-router-dom'</span>

</span>  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/Switch</span><span class="err">&gt;

    </div>

    <p>This sets up a route and captures the route parameter the app will use as the profile lookup username.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Save and close the the <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/App.jsx</code> file.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="add-a-rule-to-process-url-paths-with--dot">Add a rule to process URL paths with . (dot)</h3>

<p>You also need to add a rule to your webpack config so that you can properly
process URL paths that contain the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> (dot) character for example,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8080/other_user.id</code></p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In a production app, you must ensure the web server is configured to handle this.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open <code class="highlighter-rouge">webpack.config.js</code> in the root project directory and locate the following line:</p>

    <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nx">historyApiFallback</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
</code></pre>
    </div>

  <li>
    <p>Replace it with this:</p>

    <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nx">historyApiFallback</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="nl">disableDotRule</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
 <span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You will need to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm start</code> again for this change to take effect. Don’t
 worry, there is a later step for that to remind you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save and close the <code class="highlighter-rouge">webpack.config.js</code> file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/components/Profile.jsx</code> file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a single method that determines if the app is viewing the local user’s profile or another user’s profile.</p>

    <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nx">isLocal</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <p>You use <code class="highlighter-rouge">isLocal()</code> to check if the user is viewing the local user profile or another user’s profile. If it’s the local user profile, the app runs the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getFile()</code> function you added in an earlier step. Otherwise, the app looks up the profile belonging to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">username</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lookupProfile()</code> method.</p>
