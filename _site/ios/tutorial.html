<p>This tutorial was extensively tested using XCode 9.3 on a MacBook Air
running High Sierra 10.13.4. If your environment is different, you may encounter
slight or even major discrepancies when performing the procedures in this
tutorial. Please <a href="https://slofile.com/slack/blockstack">join the Blockstack community Slack</a> and post questions or comments to
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#support</code> channel.</p>

<p>Finally, this tutorial is written for all levels from the beginner to the most
experienced. For best results, beginners should follow the guide as written. It
is expected that the fast or furiously brilliant will skip ahead and improvise
on this material at will. God speed one and all.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can skip working through the tutorial all together. Instead,
you can <a href="#">download the final project code</a> and import it
into XCode to review it.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-sample-application-flow">Understand the sample application flow</h2>

<p>When complete, the sample application is a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> intended for use
on an iOS phone.</p>

<p><img src="images/final-app.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Only users with an existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.id</code> can run your
final sample application. When complete, users interact with the sample
application by doing the following:</p>

<p><img src="images/app-flow.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-environment">Set up your environment</h2>

<p>This sample application requires two code bases, a BlockStack <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code> web
application and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-ios</code> iOS application. You use the iOS application to run the
web application on an iOS device.</p>

<p>Before you start developing the sample, there are a few elements you need in
your environment.</p>

<h3 id="install-xcode">Install XCode</h3>

<p>If you are an experienced iOS developer and already have an iOS
development environment on your workstation, you can use that and skip this
step. However, you may need to adjust the remaining instructions for your
environment.</p>

<p>Follow the installation instructions to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">download and XCode</a> for your operating system.
Depending on your network connection, this can take between 15-30 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-npm">Do you have npm?</h3>

<p>The Blockstack code in this tutorial relies on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> dependency manager.
Before you begin, verify you have installed <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">which</code> command to
verify.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>which npm
/usr/local/bin/npm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you don’t find <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> in your system, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">install
it</a>.</p>

<h3 id="install-the-cocoapods-160beta1-dependency-manager">Install the CocoaPods 1.6.0.beta.1 dependency manager</h3>

<p>The sample application only runs on devices with iOS 11.0 or higher. You install
the Blockstack iOS SDK through the CocoaPods. Cocoapods is a dependency manager
for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It’s a simple, user friendly way to
use libraries from the community in your project.</p>

<p>You must use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.6.0.beta.1</code> version of CocoaPods or newer to avoid an
incapability between Cocoapods and XCode. Before starting the tutorial, confirm
you have installed CocoaPods.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>pod <span class="nt">--version</span>
1.6.0.beta.1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you don’t have the CocoaPods beta version, install it:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>gem install cocoapods <span class="nt">-v</span> 1.6.0.beta.1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="use-npm-to-install-yeoman-and-the-blockstack-app-generator">Use npm to install Yeoman and the Blockstack App Generator</h3>

<p>You use <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> to install Yeoman. Yeoman is a generic scaffolding system that
helps users rapidly start new projects and streamline the maintenance of
existing projects.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install Yeoman.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> npm install <span class="nt">-g</span> yo
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install the Blockstack application generator.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> npm install <span class="nt">-g</span> generator-blockstack
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <h2 id="build-the-blockstack-hello-world">Build the Blockstack hello-world</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In this section, you build a Blockstack <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> application. Then, you
modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> to interact with the iOS app via a redirect.</p>

<h3 id="generate-and-launch-your-hello-blockstack-application">Generate and launch your hello-blockstack application</h3>

<p>In this section, you build an initial React.js application called
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code> directory.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> mkdir hello-blockstack
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change into your new directory.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nb">cd </span>hello-blockstack
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Yeoman and the Blockstack application generator to create your initial <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-blockstack</code> application.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> yo blockstack:react

  <li>
    <p>Follow the prompts appropriate to your situation.</p>

    <p>If you are restoring an existing ID, you may see a prompt about your user
 being nameless, ignore it. At this point you have only a single application
 on your test server.  So, you should see this single application, with your
 own <code class="highlighter-rouge">blockstack.id</code> display name, once you are signed in:</p>

<h3 id="add-a-redirect-end-point-to-your-application">Add a redirect end point to your application</h3>

<p>When a user opens the webapp from the Blockstack browser on an iOS phone,
you want the web app to redirect the user to your iOS application. The work
you do here will allow it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>From the terminal command line, change directory to your web
application directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">public</code> directory.</p>

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">touch</code> command to add a redirect endpoint to your application.</p>

    <p>This endpoint on the web version of your app will redirect iOS users back
to your mobile app.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>touch public/redirect.html

    <p>Blockstack apps are identified by their domain names.  The endpoint will
 receive a get request with the query parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">authResponse=XXXX</code> and
 should redirect the browser to <code class="highlighter-rouge">myblockstackapp:XXXX</code>.</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">myblockstackapp:</code> is custom protocol handler. The handler should be unique
 to your application. Your app’s web-based authentication uses this handler
 to redirect the user back to your iOS app. Later, you’ll add a reference
 to this handler in your iOS application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Close and save the <code class="highlighter-rouge">redirect.html</code> file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure your Blockstack app compiles successfully.</p>

    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> process should detect and compile your change.</p>
  </li>

<p>Now, you build an iOS application that can access and run your Blockstack web
application on a mobile device.</p>

<h3 id="create-an-xcode-project">Create an XCode Project</h3>

<p>This tutorial uses XCode 9.3, you can use another version but be aware that some
menu items and therefore these procedures may be differœent on your version.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch the XCode interface.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Create new XCode project</strong>.</li>

    <p>The system prompts you for a location to store your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Save your project.</li>
  <li>Close XCode.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="add-and-edit-a-podfile">Add and edit a Podfile</h3>

<p>To use CocoaPods you need to define the XCode target to link them to.
So for example if you are writing an iOS app, it would be the name of your app.
Create a target section by writing target ‘$TARGET_NAME’ do and an end a few
lines after.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal window on your workstation.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to and change directory into the root of your project directory.</p>

<h3 id="add-the-ui-variables-to-the-viewcontroller-file">Add the UI variables to the ViewController file.</h3>

<p>In this section, you edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ViewController.swift</code> file using the storyboard as a starting point.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Main.storyboard</strong> and choose <strong>Open As &gt; Interface Builder - storyboard</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="images/main-storyboard.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the interface builder open, display the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ViewController.swift</code> file in the rigth panel.</p>

    <p><img src="images/view-editors.gif" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the storyboard, select the <strong>Sign into Blockstack</strong> button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control-drag from the button to the code display in the editor on the right, stopping the drag at the line below controller’s opening statement.</p>

    <p><img src="images/add-action.gif" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat this process with the storyboard’s purple <strong>hello-blockstack-ios</strong> label.</p>

    <p>When you are done, your ‘ViewController’ file contains the following variables:</p>

    <div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">ViewController</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIViewController</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>And XCode has added two outlines to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Main.storyboard</code> source.</p>

    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nt">&lt;connections&gt;</span>

<p>Now, you are ready to connect your application with your Blockstack Web
Application. Normally, after building your Web application you would have
registred it with Blockstack and the app would be available on the Web. This
example skips this registration step and uses an example application we’ve
already created for you:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">https://heuristic-brown-7a88f8.netlify.com/redirect.html</code></p>

<p>This web application already has a redirect in place for you. You’ll reference
this application in your mobile add for now. In XCode, do the following;</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ViewController.swift</code> file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add an import both for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Blockstack</code> and for <code class="highlighter-rouge">SafariServices</code>.</p>
