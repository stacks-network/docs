# Learm more about the Stacks token

Stacks is the name of utility token developed by Blockstack Token LLC. in 2017
and activated in the third quarter of 2018. This page discusses a general
history of the Stacks token, its current capabilities, and the future
capabilities of the token.

If you are a developer interested in the specific technical changes related to
the 2018 launch, see the [announcement in the Blockstack Forum](#).

## A brief history of the Stacks token

In 2017 Blockstack did an initial coin offering (ICO). Token holders in that ICO
received allocations of Stacks token in a draft version of the genesis block. A
genesis block is the first block of a blockchain.

During the draft period, token holders were given access to wallet software, or
they used their own hardware wallet. Token holders created a _seed phrase_ with
their wallet and stored this seed phrase (sometimes referred to as a _recovery
phrase_ or a _recovery seed_. It was each token holder’s responsibility to store
their own seed phrase in a private and secure location.

A draft of the genesis block allowed token holders to search for and verify
their allocation using addresses provided by their wallet. Beyond that, while in
draft state, token holders were locked out of using their allotted tokens.

## State of the Stacks blockchain V1

The initial block in the Stacks blockchain V1. That will allocate 1.32 billion
tokens. The launch is the culmination of two year’s hard work across the greater
Blockstack community. With the launch, Stacks tokens unlock for accredited token
holders under a predetermined unlocking schedule. The events on the unlocking
schedule are the same for each investor, **the dates of these events** depend on the
investor’s purchase date.

During the draft period, token holders were given access to wallet software, or
they used their own hardware wallet. Token holders created a seed phrase with
their wallet and stored this seed phrase (sometimes referred to as a recovery
phrase or a recovery seed. It was each token holder’s responsibility to store
their own seed phrase in a private and secure location.

This launch makes possible the following interactions:

* Token holders can purchase names and namespaces with the Stacks token. Previously, names and namespaces required the purchaser to hold Bitcoin. Initially, will be through the Blockstack command-line interface.

* Application developers an earn Stacks by building an application on the Blockstack ecosystem.

* Any Stacks tokens held at the time of launch or hold remain usable under the Blockstack Core platform.

Finally, in addition to the development of Stacks token, this launch enables
further development of Blockstack Core itself.

## Future projects of the Stacks token

The fourth quarter 2018 genesis launch is significant in that it enables the
development of new capabilities and programs for the Blockstack ecosystem. For
example, the Stacks launch enables the growth of these programs related to
mining and distribution:

  <tr>
    <th>Program</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Projected</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leader Election Mining</td>
    <td>Miners earn Stacks by burning bitcoin as fuel to generate and validate the next Stacks block.</td>
    <td>2019</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Web-of-trust mining</td>
    <td>Network users earn Stacks by performing an identity verification with a trusted party.</td>
    <td>2019</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Following shortly on the launch of the genesis block, Blockstack PBC will
release a new Stacks wallet. This wallet will enable users to check their Stacks
balance and, in future releases, send and receive Stacks tokens themselves.
