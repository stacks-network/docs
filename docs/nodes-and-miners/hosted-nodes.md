Below, you'll find some examples on the current providers that are know to support running a node.

## Quicknode

Please refer to the [Quicknode Section](./quicknode) for instructions on launching an instance with Quicknode.

## Stacks on Render

The [render-stacks](https://github.com/stacksfoundation/render-stacks) GitHub repo has instructions so anyone can deploy a Stacks node to the hosted [Render](https://render.com) service in one click.

:::note
While it is _possible_ to use the free plan with some modifications, _ ***it is recommended to run this on paid plan*** _

## Stacks on Fly
