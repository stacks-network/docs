## Stacks on Render
The [Render-Stacks GitHub repo](https://github.com/stacksfoundation/render-stacks) has instructions that make it trivially easy to deploy your own Stacks node to the hosted Render service in one click.

Follow the instructions in that repo to get up and running.

Note that it is recommended to run this on a Render paid plan. It is possible to run on the free plan with some modifications, but not recommended.
