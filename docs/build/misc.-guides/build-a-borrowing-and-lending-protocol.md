# Build a Borrowing & Lending Protocol

In this in-depth tutorial, you'll get a holistic overview of the entire Stacks development process by building a very simple borrowing and lending protocol called Lagoon.

We'll utilize the Hiro Platform to quickly get our contract set up and written. In an upcoming version of this tutorial, we'll also be creating the frontend and tests for our contract.

A written version is also in the works.

We'll also dig into sBTC a bit, the upcoming decentralized BTC peg, and how you can begin experimenting with it now.
