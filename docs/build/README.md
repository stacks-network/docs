### Hello, Builders 👋

Stacks is a fast, low-cost, builder-friendly layer 2 network on Bitcoin. It’s built on Bitcoin, inheriting Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. By jumping into our docs, you’re joining the Stacks builder community that’s bringing a global onchain economy to Bitcoin.

If you're here on this page, hopefully you've already gotten a good sense of _what_ Stacks' purpose is, if not, head to the [Learn](https://app.gitbook.com/o/hoh4mQXTl8NvI3cETroY/s/H74xqoobupBWwBsVMJhK/) section. Or if you're still on the edge of _why_ you should build with Stacks, head to [Why Build with Stacks](get-started/why-build-with-stacks.md).

### Pick your learning path

We all have different styles of learning. If you've already got a good concept of web3 fundamentals and want to get a quick taste of what the DevEx is like on Stacks, then check out the [Developer Quickstart](get-started/developer-quickstart.md). Or find the path that clicks for you — and if bandwidth allows, tackle them all!
