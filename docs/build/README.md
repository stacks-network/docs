### Hello, Builders 👋

Stacks is a fast, low-cost, builder-friendly layer 2 network on Bitcoin. It’s built on Bitcoin, inheriting Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. By jumping into our docs, you’re joining the Stacks builder community that’s bringing a global onchain economy to Bitcoin.

If you don't know Stacks' purpose, check the [Learn](https://app.gitbook.com/o/hoh4mQXTl8NvI3cETroY/s/H74xqoobupBWwBsVMJhK/) section. For why to build with Stacks, see [Why Build with Stacks](get-started/introduction/why-build-with-stacks.md).
