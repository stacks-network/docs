### Hello, Builders 👋

Stacks is a fast, low-cost, builder-friendly layer 2 network on Bitcoin. It’s built on Bitcoin, inheriting Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. By jumping into our docs, you’re joining the Stacks builder community that’s bringing a global onchain economy to Bitcoin.

If you're here on this page, hopefully you've already gotten a good sense of _what_ Stacks' purpose is, if not, head to the [Learn](https://app.gitbook.com/o/hoh4mQXTl8NvI3cETroY/s/H74xqoobupBWwBsVMJhK/) section. Or if you're still on the edge of _why_ you should build with Stacks, head to [Why Build with Stacks](get-started/readme/why-build-with-stacks.md).

***

### How to use these docs

The Stacks documentation is organized into a set of top-level sections, each aligned to a distinct stage of a developer’s journey—from learning core concepts to building applications and operating infrastructure.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Learn" %}
**How does the Stacks network&#x20;**_**actually**_**&#x20;work?**\
The [Learn](https://app.gitbook.com/s/H74xqoobupBWwBsVMJhK/) section focuses on building a strong academic foundation. It explains how Stacks functions as a Bitcoin layer 2, providing clarity and context around the network’s design and mechanics.

Topics include Proof of Transfer (PoX), Bitcoin finality, block production, the transaction lifecycle, and more. If you want a deep understanding of how Stacks anchors to Bitcoin and why it works the way it does, this is the best place to start.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Build" %}
**How do you build on Stacks?**\
This section is for experienced developers, but are new to Stacks, who are in the exploratory phase of understanding the general workflow of building apps on Stacks. These guides focus on accomplishing specific tasks—writing contracts, integrating wallets, working with sBTC or USDC—without extensive explainers.

It includes curated quick starts for smart contract development with Clarinet and frontend development with Stacks.js, along with step-by-step guides covering common use cases such as integrating sBTC, onboarding users, working with price oracles, and more.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Operate" %}
**How do you run Stacks infrastructure?**\
The [Operate](https://app.gitbook.com/s/4cpTb2lbw0LAOuMHrvhA/) section is designed for node operators and infrastructure providers. It covers how to run and manage Stacks nodes, signers, and miners.

If you’re responsible for operating or maintaining Stacks-related infrastructure, this section contains the resources you’ll need.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Reference" %}
**Where do you look up technical details?**\
The [Reference](https://app.gitbook.com/s/GVj1Z9vMuEOMe7oH7Wnq/node-operations/readme) section contains authoritative technical documentation for Stacks devtools and APIs. This includes function and type definitions for Clarity and Stacks.js, API endpoint schemas, and interactive API playgrounds.

If you’re an experienced Stacks developer looking to quickly reference a specific method, type, or API response, this section is built for fast lookup and precision.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tutorials" %}
**Looking for a more guided, lesson-oriented experience?**\
The [Tutorials](https://app.gitbook.com/s/skGYu79qDNfITOqDNU3s/) section is designed for complete beginner developers who want structured, long-form lessons rather than quick answers.

These tutorials provide step-by-step walkthroughs alongside in-depth explanations of the underlying concepts. The goal isn’t just to help you complete a task, but to help you understand _why_ things work the way they do as you build.

If you’re a complete beginner and prefer a classroom-style, concept-driven learning experience—this section is the best place to start.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
