A smooth onboarding process is crucial for applications because it directly affects user retention and engagement. Here are a few reasons why it is important:

* **User Retention**: A seamless onboarding experience helps in retaining new users by reducing friction and making it easier for them to get started with the app.
* **First Impressions**: The onboarding process shapes the first impressions of the application. A positive experience can lead to increased trust and credibility.

By prioritizing a well-designed onboarding process, developers can enhance user experience and promote wider adoption of Bitcoin/Stacks applications.
