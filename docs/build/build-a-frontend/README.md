# Build a Frontend

A major part of building full-stack Stacks applications is creating a UI with a solid user experience. One of your primary tools for this is Stacks.js, a JavaScript library built by Hiro that simplifies working with contracts and the chain.

Hiro provides documentation to help you use Stacks.js to build a frontend for your Clarity contracts.
