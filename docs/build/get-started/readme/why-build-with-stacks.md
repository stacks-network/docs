# Why Build with Stacks

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/eqFFX4Sx9mY?si=XcH6Bo3nTQusW0Tp" %}

### Why build with Stacks

Build on Bitcoin with Stacks because builders don’t need a new base layer — they need a better app layer. Stacks anchors to Bitcoin finality while enabling clear, auditable contracts and expressive logic, making BTC useful beyond holding. With production-ready tooling and one of the most active Bitcoin L2 developer communities, you get momentum, collaboration, and Bitcoin-aligned product-market fit from day one. If you want Bitcoin capital with real applications, Stacks is the path of least resistance and greatest leverage.

### What does it mean to build with Stacks

Building with Stacks means creating applications and smart contracts that _**extend**_ the power of Bitcoin without altering Bitcoin itself. It’s about inheriting Bitcoin’s security, finality, and economic gravity, while gaining the expressiveness needed for decentralized apps, ownership-first systems, and programmable digital assets.&#x20;

Developers use easy, LISP-like contracts written in the Clarity language, interact with the chain using familiar tooling like Stacks.js, automate on-chain responsiveness with Chainhooks, enable Bitcoin programmability via sBTC, and tap into indexed on-chain data through reliable APIs.&#x20;

Ultimately, **building with Stacks is a mindset**: leverage Bitcoin as the base layer, but experiment boldly at the application layer—where users keep custody of their bitcoin via sBTC, transactions enforce intent, and decentralized systems become useful enough for everyday life.
