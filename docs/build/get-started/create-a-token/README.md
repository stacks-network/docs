# Create a Token

Many Stacks projects need tokens to establish membership or as an incentive for building a thriving Web3 community. When building a project, you need to not only think about whether your project needs a token (and if so, what type), but also what other Stacks tokens your app will need to interact with.

Rather than needing to work with external libraries, Clarity has built-in functions that make working with fungible and non-fungible tokens a breeze. Below are the 3 different types of tokens available on Stacks. Click into any one of them to learn what they are and the different ways to have them launched for your project.

### Fungible Tokens

Fungible tokens on Stacks are digital assets that are interchangeable and identical in value, much like traditional currencies such as the dollar or bitcoin. They are typically used for utilities like payments, rewards, and participation rights within decentralized applications on the Stacks blockchain.

### Non-Fungible Tokens

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Stacks are unique digital assets that cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, as each token holds distinct information and value. They are often used for representing ownership of digital art, collectibles, and other unique items within decentralized applications on the Stacks network. NFTs provide a way to authenticate and trade the unique characteristics of digital goods securely.

### Semi-Fungible Tokens

Semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) are a type of digital asset that possess qualities of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. Initially, SFTs can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis like fungible tokens because they represent identical assets or goods, often in specific series or batches. However, once redeemed or utilized, they transform into non-fungible tokens, acquiring unique attributes or identification. This makes SFTs versatile for applications such as event tickets, vouchers, or gaming items where controlled fungibility is beneficial.
