## Help with translations

Translations are managed with Crowdin.
Anybody can collaborate and no technical skills are required, as it's all done on the browser.

To help with translation please go to [this page](https://crowdin.com/project/docsstacksco), click any language and start translating.

All help is appreciated.

:::caution
Please don't add any translations to the Github repository, as the translated pages get rewritten from Crowdin. Translations need to be added on Crowdin instead.

### Common issues on translations

When translating in Crowdin, please only translate the texts and not the html code.

If you accidentally modify the html tags you will get errors like shown below (`Seems like some formatting tags are missing` or `Translation contains tag that source text doesn't have`). These errors will prevent your translation getting published until the tags are left as they were in the original text.
