<summary>Why is it USDCx and not native USDC on Stacks?</summary>

USDCx is a 1:1 USDC-backed stablecoin issued through Circle xReserve and native to Stacks. xReserve provides cryptographic attestations for deposits and minting, while Circle Gateway and CCTP handle cross-chain movement. The result is USDC on Stacks without third-party bridges, wrapped assets, or fragmented liquidity.

With this setup, Stacks now has a fully USDC-backed stablecoin that plugs directly into Circle’s multichain ecosystem and brings stable, interoperable dollar liquidity to Bitcoin’s leading Layer 2. USDCx will always be fully backed by USDC on the source chain.<br>

<summary>How does USDCx differ from the other stablecoins already on Stacks?</summary>

USDCx is a fully USDC-backed, cryptographically attested dollar asset that moves across chains through Circle’s native infrastructure. It works everywhere USDC works, from Ethereum to Solana and beyond, all while settling on Bitcoin through Stacks.

With USDCx, developers get a reliable dollar rail to build with, users get predictable liquidity, and protocols get a trusted base asset for markets and collateral. It provides the missing piece for deeper liquidity, healthier markets, and real Bitcoin-denominated yield.
