# Migrating aeUSDC

### What is aeUSDC?

aeUSDC on Stacks is a bridged form of USDC managed by Allbridge. Now that USDCx is live on Stacks, aeUSDC holders should upgrade to USDCx for better liquidity, better UX and improved trust assumptions.

aeUSDC was first released in 2023. It will be gradually depreciated in favor of USDCx.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Minting aeUSDC is disabled. Users will not be able to mint new aeUSDC. Only transfers from Stacks to Ethereum enabled.
{% endhint %}

### Why should you migrate your aeUSDC to USDCx?

* **Better liquidity** → USDCx gives you deeper liquidity and smoother swaps, powered by a more connected market.
* **Better UX** → Enjoy a cleaner, faster experience with tools and apps built for real usability, not workarounds.
* **Trust & reputation via attestations** → Onchain attestations backed by trusted issuers, Circle, strengthen transparency, credibility, and confidence.

### How to migrate aeUSDC to USDCx

There are two primary ways to migrate aeUSDC tokens to USDCx. We’ll explain both of them here.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Swap via Bitflow's Conversion Pool</summary>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, the first aeUSDC:USDCx pool will be available in early January via Bitflow. This pool is not yet live.
{% endhint %}

aeUSDC holders can use the aeUSDC/USDC pool on Bitflow. This is the fastest and cheapest way to migrate to USDCx.

* Navigate to Swaps in the [Bitflow app](https://app.bitflow.finance/trade).&#x20;
* Connect your wallet.
* Select aeUSDC as the “From” token.
* Set the amount you want to migrate. You may decide to migrate your full aeUSDC balance at once, or test a small amount first before migrating the full balance.&#x20;
* Select USDCx as the “To” token.
* Click “Swap” button to initiate the swap. You’ll need to sign the transaction requests from your wallet in order to complete the transaction.

<summary><strong>Bridge via Allbridge Classic</strong></summary>

Users can bridge aeUSDC back to Ethereum and then bridge back to mint USDCx on Stacks.

* Navigate to the [Allbridge](https://app.allbridge.io/bridge?from=STX\&to=ETH\&asset=aeUSDC) app.
* Choose “Stacks” in the dropdown menu in the “From” field
* Choose “Ethereum” in the dropdown menu in the “To” field
* Choose “aeUSDC” as the asset.
* Connect your wallet.
* Set the amount you want to migrate. You may decide to migrate your full aeUSDC balance at once, or test a small amount first before migrating the full balance.&#x20;
* Note that it may take 60 minutes (six confirmation blocks) to complete the transaction.
* Once you have migrated aeUSDC back to USDC on Ethereum, you can use the USDCx Stacks bridge to deposit USDC on Stacks. http://bridge.stacks.co/
