# Dual Stack with Fordefi

{% hint style="warning" %}
This guide is specifically for entities or teams that use [Fordefi](https://fordefi.com/). This assumes you have the Fordefi wallet setup with its browser extension and with its mobile app.
{% endhint %}

The Dual Stacking Web App is the primary user interface for participating in Dual Stacking — a mechanism that allows Bitcoin holders to earn BTC-denominated rewards through sBTC, and maximize those rewards by either stacking STX or using sBTC in DeFi.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Ensure that you are using the official Dual Stacking app located at [app.stacks.co](https://app.stacks.co/).
{% endhint %}

For this guide, we'll walkthrough how you can use your Fordefi wallet in enrolling Dual Stacking and participating in DeFi for boosted rewards. This guide assumes you have a dedicated Bitcoin vault and Stacks vault setup in your Fordefi wallet.

If you need assistance in setting up your vaults in Fordefi, check out their dedicated [docs](https://docs.fordefi.com/user-guide/policies).

Before enrolling in Dual Stacking, you'll need sBTC. Peg in BTC to sBTC through the [sBTC bridge](https://app.stacks.co/) (where it remains 1:1 Bitcoin-backed at all times). Check out the dedicated guide on how you can mint sBTC to your Fordefi [wallet](https://docs.stacks.co/build/sbtc/how-to-use-the-sbtc-bridge-with-fordefi).

### Walkthrough for enrolling in Dual Stacking

Here are the necessary steps to enroll your sBTC using Fordefi:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Connect Fordefi to the Dual Stacking app

Upon popup of the connect wallet modal, select the Fordefi option to connect with. As per the usual flow of connecting your Fordefi wallet with other Stacks apps, it'll prompt you to first select your Bitcoin vault, and then your Stacks vault.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 52.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Then choose which Stacks vault you want to connect with.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Enroll now for Dual Stacking

On the dashboard, you'll be able to see stats regarding your current sBTC in wallet, sBTC in DeFi, STX currently stacked, and estimated APY you could be earning.

Let's get started by enrolling your sBTC into Dual Stacking.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 54.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click on 'Enroll now' under the 'Enroll for rewards' step.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Create transaction

Your Fordefi extension will appear with a popup asking you to review the transaction for creation. This will create the transaction which you will later sign and broadcast in your Fordefi mobile wallet.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 59 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create the transaction to queue it up in your Fordefi wallet for signing and broadcasting.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Sign transaction in Fordefi mobile app

If you navigate back to your Fordefi web wallet, you'll see the transaction queued up for signatures. Depending on the transaction policy that is setup with your Fordefi vaults, you may need to instruct the designated approvers to all confirm and sign the transaction in their Fordefi mobile wallets.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 61.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The 'enroll' transaction will be queued up in your Fordefi web wallet. You'll need to sign the transaction via the mobile wallet.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Within the Fordefi mobile wallet, you'll see the same transaction waiting for signing. Go ahead and sign the transaction which will then broadcast the transaction to the network.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Group 316124781.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Complete all signatures in the Fordefi mobile wallet.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Your enroll transaction will look like this [here](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x3b4ea853df54825adad3ab475d93be18c6a12f04033c665d4597984786feb608?chain=mainnet).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### You are now enrolled in Dual Stacking

You'll notice your sBTC now enrolled in Dual Stacking and when the rewards cycle will start for your enrolled sBTC.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 63.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>You are now Dual Stacking!</p></figcaption></figure></div>

The dashboard will also provide a view of your Dual Stacking portfolio.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 64.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>View when your sBTC will start earning rewards and the breakdown of rewards composition.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Boost rewards by stacking STX

So what's next? You could then boost your rewards by stacking STX. Let's start by stacking STX via [StackingDAO](https://www.stackingdao.com/). StackingDAO is a popular stacking option in Stacks as it is a liquid stacking method.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are other options for stacking your STX that you can find [here](https://app.leather.io/stacking).
{% endhint %}

Navigate to the StackingDAO app, connect your wallet, and start stacking. There are many methods to start liquid stacking or native stacking within StackingDAO. In this example, we'll use our STX to liquid stack with sBTC yield.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 67.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Liquid stacking with sBTC yield allows us to stay liquid and earn sBTC while stacking.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

You'll then notice the Dual Stacking app to detect your stacked positions and include that as part of your portfolio's reward composition for boosted rewards.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 68.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Notice the change in estimated APY and total portfolio value after stacking.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Let's then boost reward with Stacks DeFi. This will help reach the maximum APY boost for your sBTC.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Deploy your sBTC to Stacks DeFi protocols

You'll notice near the bottom of the dashboard page, there is a section highlighting popular DeFi protocols in Stacks. Each one of these protocols are eligible for the boosted rewards you can realize.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 69.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Let's deploy sBTC with Zest. Supplying sBTC in Zest will provide users with a supply APY. Confirm the 'Supply' transaction via the same signature flow with Fordefi.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 74.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

After deploying sBTC into Zest, navigate back to the Dual Stacking web app to see your current estimated APY and rewards composition.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image 75 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Check back on the Dual Stacking dashboard to stay current with your rewards and rewards composition. All rewards are distributed in sBTC, redeemable 1:1 for BTC anytime.
