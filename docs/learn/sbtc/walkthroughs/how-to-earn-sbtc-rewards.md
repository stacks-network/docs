# How to Earn sBTC Rewards

{% hint style="danger" %}
The last day for earning rewards through the sBTC Rewards Program will be on November 4, 2025. But don’t worry, you can earn even more sBTC with [Dual Stacking](https://app.gitbook.com/s/H74xqoobupBWwBsVMJhK/dual-stacking) - a new way to stack both STX and sBTC to create stronger alignment between Bitcoin capital and the Stacks network.
{% endhint %}

As part of the launch of sBTC, you can enroll in the sBTC rewards program and earn real yield on your BTC, paid in sBTC.

The rewards program is non-custodial — your sBTC remains in your wallet.

There are only 3 steps to participate in the sBTC rewards.

{% step %}
**Mint sBTC**

To get started, first mint your sBTC by using the bridge at [sbtc.stacks.co](https://sbtc.stacks.co/).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Connect your wallet**

After your sBTC has been minted to your wallet, visit the rewards program site at [bitcoinismore.org](https://bitcoinismore.org/) and connect your wallet. Then click the "Earn Rewards" button.

You may need to enable the sBTC token listing display in your wallet before it is visible. In Leather, you can do this by clicking "Manage Tokens" and toggling on sBTC.

{% step %}
**Enroll in the rewards program**

Finally, execute a Stacks transaction using your connected wallet to enroll in the program. You will need enough STX to cover the transaction fee to enroll in the rewards program.
