# Mainnet and Testnets

Stacks has both a mainnet and a few different testnets for different purposes. Mainnet and testnet are two completely different networks and tokens cannot be transferred between one or the other.

### Mainnet

Stacks mainnet is directly connected to Bitcoin mainnet and is the network where tokens have actual monetary worth. This is the production network and should be treated as such.

You can view mainnet activity using [Hiro's block explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/).

### Primary and Nakamoto Testnets

There are some notable differences between Primary Testnet and Nakamoto Testnet; this table can guide you in selecting the one most aligned with your needs.

### Important notes on the Primary Testnet

* Core devs are working on a BTC Regtest Explorer. In the meantime, Wallet, Explorer, and API links to BTC transactions will lead you nowhere. This is expected and will be addressed. All STX transactions are available to track on the [Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet).
* You can start onboarding your Signer, deploy contracts and test your Apps. All functionality from the previous testnet is available.
* Old testnet data is archived and will remain [available](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet\&api=https://api.old.testnet.hiro.so) until the end of June 2024
* Faucet and tSTX:
  * The [Faucet address](https://explorer.hiro.so/address/ST2QKZ4FKHAH1NQKYKYAYZPY440FEPK7GZ1R5HBP2?chain=testnet) and limits stay the same.
  * If you need more tSTX than the current daily limit to onboard your Signer on Primary Testnet, please reach out to your main point of contact in the ecosystem.

### About Testnet

The testnet is a separate blockchain from the Stacks mainnet analogous to a staging environnement. It's a network used by developers to test their apps, smart contracts, or changes to the protocol in a production-like environment.

It produces blocks at roughly the same rate as mainnet; about 1 block every 10 minutes on average. The Stacks testnet is rarely reset.

#### Faucets

Testnet faucets provide you with free Stacks Token (STX) to test with. These are not the same as STX on mainnet and have no value. There are a couple of different options for getting testnet STX.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Hiro" %}
You can get STX from the Hiro faucet on the [Hiro Explorer Sandbox](https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet), or using the [API](https://docs.hiro.so/api#tag/Faucets).

To get STX tokens from within the Explorer Sandbox, navigate to the "Faucet" tab on the left and click "Request STX" button.

You can also try out Stacking by clicking on `I want to stack`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Explorer Sandbox requires you to login with a Stacks wallet
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LearnWeb3" %}
Alternatively, you can use the [LearnWeb3 faucet](https://learnweb3.io/faucets).

#### Testnet API

The hosted Stacks Blockchain API for the testnet is available at this base URL:
