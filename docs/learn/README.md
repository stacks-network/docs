### Stacks: The TL;DR

Stacks activates the Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin is the most adopted, most valuable, and most decentralized cryptocurrency. The Stacks L2 enables fast, cheap BTC and full-featured smart contracts on the L2 without modifying Bitcoin itself. Users and developers can use BTC in their apps and pay gas fees with BTC. All transactions on Stacks L2 are secured by Bitcoin L1 with 100% finality, enabling you to build apps and digital assets that are integrated&#x20;with Bitcoin security.

The Stacks layer for smart contracts has the following innovations that make it unique:

**S**: Secured by the entire hash power of Bitcoin (Bitcoin finality).\
**T**: Trust-minimized Bitcoin peg mechanism; write to Bitcoin.\
**A**: Atomic BTC swaps and assets owned by BTC addresses.\
**C**: Clarity language for safe, decidable smart contracts.\
**K**: Knowledge of full Bitcoin state; read from Bitcoin.\
**S**: Scalable, fast transactions that settle on Bitcoin.

### Why learn the fundamentals of Stacks?

Stacks fundamentals give you the intuition to build apps that are safer, more Bitcoin-aligned, and more future-proof. A developer who learns the basics doesn’t just write Clarity—they build apps that actually _feel like_ Bitcoin apps.

1. You'll build apps that actually leverage Bitcoin
2. You'll avoid costly design mistakes
3. You'll write better smart contracts
4. You'll use sBTC and Bitcoin writes correctly
