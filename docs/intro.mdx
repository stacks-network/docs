# Stacks Docs

**Stacks brings smart contract functionality to Bitcoin, without modifying Bitcoin itself.**

These docs serve as:
1. An introduction to Stacks (what it is, why you should care, how to build on it),
2. A reference guide to various aspects of the Stacks ecosystem
3. A collection of tutorials and code samples to help you learn and build

If you see something you think you might want to contribute, [please do so](/docs/contribute)! We are always looking for good contributions from the community.

## Tutorials
