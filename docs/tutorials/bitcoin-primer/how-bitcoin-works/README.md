# How Bitcoin Works

You are probably already familiar with how Bitcoin works at a high level, that it uses proof of work, has miners, etc. But to be able to start building with it, it's important to get an in-depth knowledge of how it works under the hood.

This module is going to serve as an introduction to how Bitcoin operates under the hood. We'll look at how mining works, the hashing algorithm Bitcoin uses, transactions, UTXOs, basic public key cryptography and address generation, and more.

We'll go through step by step, looking at how each component works and how they all interact to create the blockchain itself.
