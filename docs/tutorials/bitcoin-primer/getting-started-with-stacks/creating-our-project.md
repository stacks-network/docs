# Creating Our Project

In order to create Crowdforge, we're going to take advantage of the Hiro Platform project templates. These are starter templates with a full-stack setup with best practices already implemented.

By using these templates, we'll be able to learn best practices from them and get started on the right foot.

For the rest of this course, we'll be working from this template, first getting a walkthrough of the template structure itself, getting introduced to the Stacks dev tooling ecosystem along the way.

Then we'll add a new feature, following the same practices as the template uses so we can see how to work with it ourselves.

For a walkthrough of the templates themselves and the ideas/goals behind their design, be sure to check out the [Hiro Dev n' Tell with Leah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3fRUUgFxsA), one of the software engineers in charge of building them.
