  In this guide, you'll build a simple counter smart contract and interact with
  it in a local environment.

# Quickstart

## What you'll learn

* Create a Clarity smart contract project
* Write Clarity code with maps and public functions
* Test and validate your contracts using Clarinet's console

## Prerequisites

* Clarinet installed on your machine. Follow the [installation guide](overview.md#installation) if needed.
* A code editor like VS Code for editing Clarity files.

### Create your project

Let's start by creating a new Clarinet project. The `clarinet new` command sets up everything you need for smart contract development, including a testing framework, deployment configurations, and a local development environment:

```bash
clarinet new counter
```

Clarinet creates a complete project structure for you. Each folder serves a specific purpose in your development workflow:

```
- counter/
  - contracts/
  - settings/
    - Devnet.toml
    - Mainnet.toml
    - Testnet.toml
  - tests/
    - Clarinet.toml
    - package.json
    - vitest.config.js
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Generate your contract

Now that we have our project structure, let's create a smart contract. Navigate into your project directory and use Clarinet's contract generator:

```bash
$ cd counter
$ clarinet contract new counter
Created file contracts/counter.clar
Created file tests/counter.test.ts
Updated Clarinet.toml with contract counter
```

Clarinet automatically creates both your contract file and a corresponding test file. This follows the best practice of writing tests alongside your contract code:

| File                     | Purpose                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `contracts/counter.clar` | Your smart contract code    |
| `tests/counter.test.ts`  | Test file for your contract |

{% hint style="info" %}
Notice that Clarinet also updated your `Clarinet.toml` file. This configuration file tracks all contracts in your project and their deployment settings.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Write your contract code

Open `contracts/counter.clar` and replace its contents with our counter implementation. This contract will maintain a separate count for each user who interacts with it:

{% code title="contracts/counter.clar" %}
```lisp
;; Define a map to store counts for each user
(define-map counters principal uint)

;; Increment the count for the caller
(define-public (count-up)
  (ok (map-set counters tx-sender (+ (get-count tx-sender) u1)))
)

;; Get the current count for a user
(define-read-only (get-count (who principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? counters who))
)
```
{% endcode %}

Let's understand what each part does:

* `define-map` creates a persistent storage map that associates each user (principal) with their count
* `tx-sender` is a built-in variable that contains the address of whoever calls the function
* `define-public` declares functions that can modify contract state
* `define-read-only` declares functions that only read data without modifying it
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Validate your contract

Before we can test our contract, let's make sure it's syntactically correct and type-safe. Clarinet's check command analyzes your contract without deploying it:

```bash
clarinet check
```

If you see errors instead, here are the most common issues and how to fix them:

| Error                 | Fix                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Unknown keyword`     | Check spelling of Clarity functions                                           |
| `Type mismatch`       | Ensure you're using correct types (uint, principal, etc.)                     |
| `Unresolved contract` | Verify contract name in `Clarinet.toml` matches the contract name in the file |
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Test in the console

Now for the exciting partâ€”let's interact with our contract! Clarinet provides an interactive console where you can call functions and see results immediately. Start the console with:

```bash
clarinet console
```

Once the console loads, you can call your contract functions directly. Here are a few examples you can try:

```lisp
$ (contract-call? .counter count-up)
(ok true)
$ (contract-call? .counter get-count tx-sender)
u1
$ (contract-call? .counter count-up)
(ok true)
$ (contract-call? .counter get-count tx-sender)
u2
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
