## Stacks Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

Stacks improvement proposals (SIPs) are aimed at describing the implementation of the Stacks blockchain, as well as proposing improvements.

The SIP process [(SIP-000)](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-000/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md) describes how to make a SIP and get it ratified.

They should contain concise technical specifications of features or standards and the rationale behind it. SIPs are intended to be the primary medium for proposing new features, for collecting community input on a system-wide issue, and for documenting design decisions.

The SIPs are located in the [stacksgov/sips](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips) repository as part of the [Stacks Community Governance organization](https://github.com/stacksgov).

Anyone in the Stacks community can submit a SIP.
