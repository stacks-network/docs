# Sample Configuration Files

Below are sample configuration files for running a Stacks node and signer provided in one place for convenience. You'll need to modify some of these according to the [How to Run a Signer](running-a-signer.md) doc.

### Testnet Signer

```toml
# The IP address and port where your Stacks node can be accessed. 
# The port 20443 is the default RPC endpoint for Stacks nodes. 
# Note that you must use an IP address - DNS hosts are not supported at this time.
# This should be the IP address accessible via Docker, usually via a network.
node_host = "127.0.0.1:20443"

# This is the location where the signer will expose an RPC endpoint for 
# receiving events from your Stacks node.
endpoint = "0.0.0.0:30000"

# Either “testnet” or “mainnet”
network = "testnet"

# this is a file path where your signer will persist data. If using Docker, 
# this must be within a volume, so that data can be persisted across restarts
db_path = "/var/stacks/signer.sqlite"

# an authentication token that is used for some HTTP requests made from the 
# signer to your Stacks node. You’ll need to use this later on when configuring 
# your Stacks node. You create this field yourself, rather than it being generated 
# with your private key.
auth_password = "$your_http_auth_token"

# This is the privateKey field from the keys you generated in the 
# previous step.
stacks_private_key = "$your_stacks_private_key"
```

### Nakamoto Testnet Config

This is the configuration you'll need to run a Stacks follower node if you are also running a signer. Be sure to change the commented lines to the appropriate data for your setup. If you are not familiar with the process of setting up a signer, be sure to follow the [How to Run a Signer](running-a-signer.md) guide.

An overview of all Stacks node configuration options can be found in the [Stacks Node Configuration](../../stacks-in-depth/nodes-and-miners/stacks-node-configuration.md) doc.

Additions necessary specifically to run a signer are the `[connection_options]` and `[[events_observer]]` sections and the `stacker = true` line. There are also a few comments detailing other lines that need to change.

### Mainnet Signer

This config is very similar to the testnet config, except the `network` field is changed.

```toml
# The IP address and port where your Stacks node can be accessed. 
# The port 20443 is the default RPC endpoint for Stacks nodes. 
# Note that you must use an IP address - DNS hosts are not supported at this time.
# This should be the IP address accessible via Docker, usually via a network.
node_host = "127.0.0.1:20443"

# This is the location where the signer will expose an RPC endpoint for 
# receiving events from your Stacks node.
endpoint = "0.0.0.0:30000"

# Either “testnet” or “mainnet”
network = "mainnet"

# this is a file path where your signer will persist data. If using Docker, 
# this must be within a volume, so that data can be persisted across restarts
db_path = "/var/stacks/signer.sqlite"

# an authentication token that is used for some HTTP requests made from the 
# signer to your Stacks node. You’ll need to use this later on when configuring 
# your Stacks node. You create this field yourself, rather than it being generated 
# with your private key.
auth_password = "$your_http_auth_token"

# This is the privateKey field from the keys you generated in the 
# previous step.
stacks_private_key = "$your_stacks_private_key"
```

### Mainnet Stacks Node

With a mainnet Stacks node config, you'll need to change the bootstrap node field and the burnchain fields. Other than that, the `ustx_balance` fields are not necessary.

```toml

# the chain state archive as described in the How to Run a Signer guide:

```
