# Nakamoto & Primary Testnet

<details>

<summary>Recent Testnet History (May 2024)</summary>

Over the past month+, the Bitcoin Testnet has slowly become[ unusable](https://blog.lopp.net/griefing-bitcoin-testnet/). Given the Primary Stacks Testnet leverages Bitcoin to provide a realistic environment, the Stacks testnet also became unusable. To overcome this, the core developers spun up the [Nakamoto Testnet](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet\&api=https://api.nakamoto.testnet.hiro.so) to unblock Signers and test ahead of [Nakamoto Instantiation](nakamoto-rollout-plan/). \
\
In the background, they have also been working to bring the Primary Testnet back. To achieve this, they migrated the Primary Stacks testnet to the Bitcoin Regtest network. As of May 31st, the Primary Testnet is back and ready to use.&#x20;

### Important notes on the Primary Testnet:

* Core devs are working on a BTC Regtest Explorer. In the meantime, Wallet, Explorer, and API links to BTC transactions will lead you nowhere. This is expected and will be addressed. All STX transactions are available to track on the [Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet).
* You can start onboarding your Signer, deploy contracts and test your Apps. All functionality from the previous testnet is available.
* Old testnet data is archived and will remain [available](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet\&api=https://api.old.testnet.hiro.so) until the end of June 2024
* **Faucet and tSTX:**
  * The [Faucet address](https://explorer.hiro.so/address/ST2QKZ4FKHAH1NQKYKYAYZPY440FEPK7GZ1R5HBP2?chain=testnet) and limits stay the same. Learn more about faucets: [testnet.md](../stacks-101/testnet.md "mention")
  * If you need more tSTX than the current daily limit to onboard your Signer on Primary Testnet, please reach out to your main point of contact in the ecosystem.
