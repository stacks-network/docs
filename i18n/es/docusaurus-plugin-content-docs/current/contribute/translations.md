Please don't add any translations to the Github repository, as the translated pages get rewritten from Crowin. Translations need to be added on Crowin intead.

### Common issues on translations

When translating in Crowdin, please only translate the texts and not the html code.

If you acccidently modify the html tags you will get errors like shown below (`Seems like some formating tags are missing` or `Translation contains tag that source text doesn't have`). These errors will prevent your translation getting published until the tags are left as they were in the original text.
