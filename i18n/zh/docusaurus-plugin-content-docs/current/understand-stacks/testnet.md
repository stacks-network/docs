## About testnet

The testnet is a separate blockchain from the Stacks mainnet analogous to a staging environnment. It's a network used by developers to test their apps, smart contracts, or changes to the protocol in a production-like environment. It produces blocks at roughly the same rate as mainnet; about 1 block every 10 minutes on average. The Stacks testnet is rarely reset.
