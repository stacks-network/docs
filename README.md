# Stacks Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Stacks, a Bitcoin Layer 2 that brings fast transactions, low fees, and full-featured smart contracts to Bitcoin. This comprehensive resource empowers you to understand, build on, and operate within the Stacks ecosystem.

---

## About These Docs

The Stacks documentation serves three core audiences:

**🛠️ Developers** — Build decentralized applications and deploy smart contracts using Clarity, Stacks.js, and a robust developer toolkit.

**⚙️ Operators** — Run nodes, miners, and signers to support and secure the network infrastructure.

**📚 Learners** — Understand how Stacks activates Bitcoin's potential through its unique technical architecture and creates a truly Bitcoin-native onchain economy.

From beginner quickstarts to advanced technical references, these docs provide everything you need to participate in building the future of Bitcoin.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into five main sections (Spaces), each designed to guide you through different aspects of Stacks:

### **Learn**
Deep technical explanations and conceptual breakdowns covering the core components of Stacks. Understand the "why" and "how" behind Stacks' architecture, consensus mechanisms, and relationship with Bitcoin.

### **Build**
Practical resources for developers including quickstarts, how-to guides, integration examples, Clarinet tutorials, Stacks.js documentation, and code samples. Everything you need to start building today.

### **Operate**
Complete setup and configuration guides for running Stacks infrastructure including nodes, miners, and signers. Learn how to contribute to network security and decentralization.

### **Reference**
Technical specifications and API documentation including Clarity language details, protocol specifications, SDK references, and comprehensive tooling documentation.

### **Tutorials**
Step-by-step walkthroughs that guide you through building complete applications from start to finish, helping you master Stacks development through hands-on practice.

## How the Docs Work

The Stacks documentation is built using **GitBook** with two-way synchronization to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stacks-network/docs). This means changes made in either location are automatically reflected in the other.

### Structure

Each documentation Space consists of:

- **`.gitbook/`** — Assets folder containing images, PDFs, and other media
- **`README.md`** — The landing page for that section
- **`SUMMARY.md`** — Table of contents defining the section's structure
- **Content files** — Markdown files containing the actual documentation

All documentation content is written in standard Markdown format, making it easy to read, edit, and contribute.
